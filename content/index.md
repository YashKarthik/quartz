Hi. I'm Yash. I do lots of different things, but when someone asks me what I do, I usually reply with "programming". I love to build things(!) and work on projects I find interesting.


Last term I took linear alrgebra and **absolutely** loved it! This site is mainly for sharing my [[Courses/MATH115/|Linear Algebra]] notes.

I started the term by assuming this would be my worst course (I hated computing cofactors and inverses in high school), but discovered lin alg is so much more than boring computations.

These pages contain my explanations (to myself) without the rigor of math, instead with a _feel_ for the matrix.
