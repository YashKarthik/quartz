- The best way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies.
- Anomalies are everywhere, but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge.
- When you learn enough about a particular subject, you'll realize that the knowledge is full of gaps (these gaps are invisible when you're not learned enough).
- These gaps will be obvious to the pro, and that's when you'll wonder why no one has tried _x_ or thought about _y_.
