# Principle
- Generates electricity by placing a turbine in the path of flowing water.
- Functions very similar to [[References/Wind Turbines]]
# Pros
- But more efficient that wind / generate more power for less size.
- Since water is denser than air, water turbines can generate significant power even at low water speed.
- Almost no damage to the ecosystem.
	- Likely: because the turbines are placed where water speed is high, relatively less sediment is formed and less fish habit that area.
