- Find the best ingredients possible to ferment into great ideas, and aggressively prune everything you don’t want your brain to process. Because [[Evergreen/Whatever you pay attention to is being fermented by your brain]].

- Give your brain the boredom and output time it needs to figure out what to do with that information. Don’t keep opening the jar and packing more into it. Because [[Evergreen/Good ideas require boredom because that's when the brain flexes it's "idea muscles"]].

- Finally, be patient with the process. The more you can reduce the amount of information you’re taking in, and the more boredom you can give your brain to work, the better your results will be.
