Creatives and managers schedule different sized blocks of time.

# Creatives' Schedule
- Creatives usually divide up a day into pre-lunch, post-lunch.
- This is because doing some solid coding / writing requires several hours of focused effort.
- Adding new tasks and meetings is hard cuz you have to change you _brain mode_.
- Meetings blow up an entire section of your day.
	- It feels different in the morning when you have an entire day to build your app. 
	- When you have a meeting it puts some background stress.
# Managers' Schedule
- Managers on the other hand divide their day into hour-long blocks.
- It's easy for them to add tasks and meetings; it's as simple as putting it in their calendar.
- A manager's schedule also allows for more "grab a coffee" type speculative interactions. Cuz its basically filling in a free slot.
