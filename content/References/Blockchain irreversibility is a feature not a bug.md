- Many consider Trad-fi to be safe because of the centralized intermediaries that "protect" them from mistake txs.

# Cons of Reversibility
- Intermediaries can basically control the money in your bank. If someone transfers a million into your account by mistake, it's not yet yours.

# Alternative: escrow
- Reversible txs allow money to keep moving even though it might get reversed. This harms innocent bystanders.
- Escrows lock the funds until the payment is finalized.
