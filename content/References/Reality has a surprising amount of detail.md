Nothing is as straightforward as it seems.

# Analogy
- It's kinda like white-paper vs yellow-paper.
- White-papers discuss a problem, and an idea for a mechanism that could solve the problem.
- Yellow-papers go into the details of _how_ the mechanism is implemented.
# In Programming
- This would resonate well with programmers as their job is to take an idea and implement it.
- We run into problems all the time where the proposed idea / mechanism is not practically viable to implement.
- This un-straightforward-ness is not specific to programming. We just encounter it more because we try out new stuff more frequently.
- Eg: Newtonian Physics
	- Newtonian laws are simple, in theory. They are easy to understand.
	- But when you first start applying them to problems you'll run into all sorts of weird quirks. Most common one for me was: forgetting to apply all the components of friction to each of the bodies.
	- But after running into enough walls you just remember stuff. And wonder how stupid does someone have to be to forget to apply friction!
