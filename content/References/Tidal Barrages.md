# Principle
- Building a barrage in the path of tidal water flow.
- Turbines installed in the barrage wall generate power as water flows in and out of the basin.
-  Different types exist depending on how they capture water, and when the water spins the turbine.
# Cons
- Huge upfront investment.
- Massive ecological disturbance.
