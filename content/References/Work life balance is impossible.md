- The word balance is the problem in the term work-life balance: [[Fleeting/How language shapes our understanding of the world]]

- The word balance, in our minds, puts work and life at odds. As if they are two opposing forces battling for our time.
- But work is just another part of our life.
- We should think of all the different parts of our life as interlocking cogs or processes of a giant machine called life.
- When you use a certain cog too much, we risk overuseâ€“burnout. Especially at the cost of other cogs, which in-turn affect performance of the entire machine.
