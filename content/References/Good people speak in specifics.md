- How do you tell if someone was there when it happened vs made it happen.
- Eg: someone comes from Google. How do you tell if the person made meaningful contributions to the product or just coasted behind a good team.
- People who actually did something speak with a high level of detail because [[References/Reality has a surprising amount of detail]]
- People who just coasted often speak in abstractions and can't expand upon them.
