> Law shapes the acceptable bounds for culture, yet culture is a leading indicator for law.
# How does Law shape Culture?
- Criminalizing (or even making hard) certain activities pushes them out of the mainstream. Eg:
	- Europe's red tape has dampened the entrepreneurial culture there.
	- US's soft criminalization of cryptocurrencies has led to strong decentralization in base layer.
- Laws also attract (or repel) people that share the the culture the law promotes.
	- Silicon Valley is not a place, but a people.
	- Taxes, extradition push people to places.
# How does Culture shape Law?
- As the culture becomes mainstream, politicians supporting the culture eventually rise to power and laws are shaped based on the culture. Eg:
	- UBI, stimulus, drugs.
	- Bitcoin's culture determined the winner of the blocksize wars. Ethereum's culture determined the outcome of the DAO fork.
# Culture Instead of Law
- Law should lay down the bare minimum needed to thrive.
- Guiding principles should come from culture instead.
- Law should be flexible enough to enable innovation but rigid enough to prevent malicious abuse.
