I've watched the anime for this in a weird fashion. On Netflix on :re is available so I watched that and then realized that I'd seen the third season. I abandoned it for a while then last year I watched the first two seasons of anime, against the subreddit's advice. The anime was initially pretty good, but the second season was confusing and left out the ending. Turns out that the S2 is completely made up and doesn't even follow the original manga. I abandoned the series at that time.

This ~April, since college admissions were pretty much done I started reading a lot of books. All those year of starvation, now finally ended. I dove into Harry Potter and then the Percy Jackson universe and it was nice and nostalgic. I wanted to read more advanced fantasy like that thrones series everyone on Instagram seems to love, but after four thick series of novels, I wanted a change of pace. I considered some sci-fi but after Neuromancer, it was scary. I didn't want to _not_ read. For some reason I was back into anime and stuff but wanted to read..... so manga. I figured this would be the perfect time to dive back into Tokyo Ghoul and discover Ken Kaneki for real.

Wow. Just wow. This one has incredible character depth. Not just the main character, pretty much all the important ones have really interesting backgrounds. And their background actively influences their decisions and presumptions about a lot of stuff. It's not like those books that have cool background, but their current life seems disconnected from. Here every character's background relates to how behave. The entire main cast has had a tragic life, the ghouls and the investigators.

Kaneki's entry into the ghoul world is similar to Elena discovering Stephan's a vamp, but with two extra twists: it's the MC themself and morality. It's weird that morality of vamps drinking blood was never explored well. It's mostly just ruled off as disgusting and the good guys don't harm humans. It's cool that ghouls can't live off animal meat; they _require_ human meat.

It's also cool that even though Kaneki is the main character, he doesn't become macho-man after turning into a ghoul. He's just Touka's weaker, kinder friend for most of the time, until his capture by Aogiri.

Touka is a little more conventional though. She's super strong, but I guess since she's female (and this comic's Japanese), there has to be a damsel in distress scene. It's not as cringe though. Her victim moment is partly because she's fighting her own brother, so she's pulling her punches. This is also Kaneki's rebirth as a protector. Finally breaking past his mother's lessons on inflicting pain. So I guess the moment is justified.

Even then her character is pretty good overall.
