I learned to code in Python. It's a nice language, but it was hard. I spent hours googling until someone on a forum pointed out my indentation mismatch. When I picked up webdev, it was a similar ordeal. Though with fewer import errors. I've been learning C recently; I still don't understand how int* is related to int[].
