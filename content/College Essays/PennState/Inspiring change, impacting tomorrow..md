One time my friend and I had to clean the robotics lab after a night of intense brainstorming. Rather than sweeping and sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us. I knew how transformative technology is. It has been all around us. But actually using it to automate (+make fun) a mundane task, like cleaning up a lab, was when I truly grokked the power of technology.

Determined to share this superpower with others, we convinced our club-advisor (computer-science teacher) to give some talks, seminars on introductory topics. Despite doing this, every Friday, for almost two months, we didn't gain much traction.

As a self-taught programmer, I knew the hardest part about learning to code was getting started. I realized that the person giving the seminars should be relatable to the new members. It should've been us, not our club-advisor, conducting classes.

As club lead, I started conducting weekly workshops on robot design and programming. We conducted 'theory classes' to teach concepts and 'maker sessions' to test the concepts and inculcate the ‘learn by doing’ attitude in everyone.

The new workshops were an instant hit, and before long we had a thriving community learning from each other. It was like a flywheel, with the new members teaching others and creating a network effect that helped everyone learn and grow.

As a tech enthusiast, improving lives using technology is important to me and what better way than introducing others to this superpower.
