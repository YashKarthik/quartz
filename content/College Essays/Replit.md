# Why Replit

I remember the day I got interested in coding. 7th grade, robotics lab, our first club meeting. I built a tiny race car, simple but it opened my mind to the limitless possibilities of technology. 5 years on, I'm introducing my 10 year old bro to coding. I Googled "teaching coding to kids" and Replit was among the first results.

There's something _magical_ about code and tech; it enables a person from one corner of the world to affect another person in another corner of the world. And what better way to "affect" someone else, than making it easy for them to code.

# Why You

The sheer joy of making things has propelled me to go beyond my classroom, explore my interests, try different things, and meet new people. Combine this with my first-hand experience teaching coding to my classmates, and now, my brother, I have a unique perspective of what it's like learning to code in the current day.

With my passion for empowering students with code and my experience building "nifty lil' projects", I believe that my skills and experience align well with Replit's mission to make coding more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

# Project most proud of: Enscan

Recently, I've been using this app called Farcaster (Warpcast). It's essentially a blockchain-powered Twitter. Being blockchain-powered, it has tab on users' profiles that shows the NFTs held by the user. I wanted to build something similar for Twitter. A browser extension that uses "content scripts" to place an NFT tab on users' profiles. 

While building this I ran into another problem, figuring out the address of the user based on the Twitter username. I planned to do this via ENS (Ethereum Name Service), but it turned out there was no native way to do this. Here's where I had another idea: Enscan. An indexer for ENS that scrapes the data and stores it in a SQL db making querying much more powerful.

I'm really proud of Enscan because it's the classic example of the "hacker ethos": run into a problem? Build a solution!

# Experience with Web development

I've been coding on-and-off since ~2016, and got serious about it in 2020. I'm a "full-stack" web developer, so I'm comfortable working in the backend as well as frontend.

In the backend, I have experience working with Express, Fastify in JS; Django and Flask in Python; and currently learning Go. Recently, I've been experimenting with "serverless" backend for less traditional situations. I find them to be simple and sufficient for most tasks. On the database side of things, I prefer working with SQL and usually go with Supabase for most projects, but switch to Planetscale or Railway when I need more control over the DB.

My expertise is in React, especially using Next.js, though I sometime dabble in modern alternatives like Solid.js. I'm comfortable working with React and also its large ecosystem; I've dabbled in multiple CSS libraries, from Chakra UI to MUI to Emotion to Tailwind; I've experimented with different query/fetching libraries like Axios, React-Query, Apollo, Urql; I "love" Typescript and value type-safety so-much-so that I've used tRPC in almost all my recent projects.

When I'm not building something myself, I can be found hanging around / answering questions in my favorite projects' Discord servers.
