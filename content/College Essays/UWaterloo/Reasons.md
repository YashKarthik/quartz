One time my friend and I had to clean the robotics lab after a late night building-session. Rather than spending hours sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us.

I _knew_ how transformative technology is. It has been all around us. But actually _applying_ it myself to automate a mundane task was when I truly **grokked** the power of technology.

Studying Computer Science/Computer Engineering at Waterloo, will provide me with a strong foundation in mathematics, problem-solving and the principles of computation; empowering me to explore innovative solutions to complex problems in the world today.

In addition to the rigorous curriculum I'm also drawn to Waterloo's unique co-op program which would enable me to combine classroom learning with real world experience.

Programming to me is like a _superpower_ and I am eager to upgrade this skill by studying at Waterloo.
