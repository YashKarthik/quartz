As a newbie in Lawrence School, Lovedale, I was attracted to the serenity and the intellectual environment of the library. Though I started with reading, I quickly jumped to the internet. While surfing the web I stumbled upon CS50 which introduced me to programming.

Fast forward 6 years. I've moved on from Scratch & Legos to Python and Raspberry Pi's. Over this period, I took to the internet to further my interest in coding & robotics. I attended courses on EdX, Coursera; worked with programmers world-wide on open source projects; and learnt the tricks and nuances of this art. During the summer of 2022, I interned at Invento Robotics, Bangalore where I designed user interfaces to make them differently-abled-friendly.
