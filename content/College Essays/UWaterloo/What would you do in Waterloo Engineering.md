I joined my school robotics club, kinda by accident, but it turned out to be a fantastic decision. There, I became captivated by the potential of programming and developed a  fascination with robots. Today, I'm eager to join Waterloo's self-driving car project–WATonomous–specifically the software sub-team where I would gain a deeper understanding of computer vision and autonomous systems. I am also excited to explore the extensive artificial-intelligence-related classes at Waterloo, combining my interests in robotics and AI.

One of the most attractive parts about Waterloo Engineering is its unique co-op program which would give me an opportunity to work with industry-leading mentors and test my knowledge in the real-world.

I’ll be uniquely positioned to shape the future of technology and its impact on our world!

The _Warrior_ ethos of learning-by-doing resonates deeply with me, and I am excited to learn and grow with others of this tribe.
