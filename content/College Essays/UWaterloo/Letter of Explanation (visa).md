Subject: Application for Study Permit

Dear Visa Officer,

I am writing this letter to provide additional information and explanations in support of my Canadian study permit application as an incoming student at the University of Waterloo. I understand that in order for me to be granted admission in Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) - must be satisfied about my genuine intentions to come to Canada only for the purpose of studies and thereafter upon completion have genuine incentives in place for me to return to India which is my home country.

Since this will be the only opportunity to present my case to you – I am writing this letter to clearly detail my intentions and describe my circumstances up to this point. I will also mention all the aspects that have helped me make my decision, including research and my career goals.

## Personal Background:
I Yashashwin Karthikeyan was born on 13th March 2004, and am currently 19 years old. My family consists of me, my mother Mrs. K Kalyani - who is a home maker, my father Mr. M Karthikeyan who is a senior executive at Group 4 Securitas (G4S India) and my brother - Vivaan Karthikeyan who is a middle school student.

## Academic Credentials

I have completed my schooling from Kola Saraswathi Vaishnav Senior Secondary School, Chennai. I completed my secondary education – Year 10 in March 2020 and secured an aggregate of 95% in the examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

I completed my high school, Year - 12, in 2012 and obtained aggregate of 95% in the All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE), an examination conducted every year by the CBSE for grade 12.

I took the TOEFL exam on 11th November 2022 and secured a total score of 109; I then took the IELTS Academic exam on 5th May 2023 and scored an overall band score of 8.5 and no band less than 7–with the objective of being eligible for a Canadian Study Permit.

## Academic and Career Goals

From an early age, my passion for science and mathematics fueled my curiosity and developed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fascination laid the groundwork for my academic journey and shaped my future aspirations.

As I delved deeper into mathematics, I discovered programming through the internet. Coding allowed me to merge my love for math with the gratification of creating functional solutions. Programming became an outlet for my creativity and logical thinking.

To further enhance my programming skills, I joined my school's robotics club and later became President, where I not only honed my technical abilities but also had the privilege of teaching and sharing my knowledge with younger students. I revamped the application process for the club and led our team to two World Robot Olympiads (WRO) and in 2019 qualified to the national level of WRO.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, confined to my home, I turned to the internet. I embarked on diverse projects, from web apps, to data science exploration, and experimentation with Ethereum smart contracts, which broadened my skill sets and deepened my understanding of various technologies. I joined online communities (Hack Club) and forums to discuss and collaborate on projects. Additionally, I enrolled in online college-level courses in physics and computer science. Notably, I completed Dr. Dan Boneh's Cryptography I course, solidifying my theoretical foundation in the math behind modern computing.

Over the long term, my aspiration to work in technology startups aligns with my passion for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, driving me to contribute to the dynamic and transformative landscape of the tech industry.

## Comparing Canadian Universities with Universities in India

There is no shortage of Engineering courses in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. After extensive research, I have identified some of the best courses and premier institutes offering a bachelor's degree in computing, including Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Sciences, Delhi Technological University (DTU).

However, Indian universities often lack a diverse student cohort that fosters a variety of opinions and ideas, which is in stark contrast to the inclusive and diverse environment found in universities in Canada.

Moreover, Indian universities often focus more on theoretical knowledge that incentivizes rote learning over practical and applied problem solving skills.

There are several reasons why I am interested in studying in Canada, and particularly at the University of Waterloo.

Firstly, the University of Waterloo is renowned for its comprehensive and practical education in the field of computer engineering. The university places a strong emphasis on hands-on learning, which I believe is crucial for developing practical skills that can be directly applied in the industry.

Additionally, the University of Waterloo's highly reputed cooperative education programs offer a truly unmatched opportunity to apply our skills in the real world. This practical exposure to the industry will not only enhance my knowledge and skills but also allow me to establish valuable connections and increase my employability upon graduation.

Furthermore, the University of Waterloo boasts a vibrant and diverse community, attracting students from all over the world. This multicultural environment fosters a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives, which I believe is essential for personal and intellectual growth. Interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds will broaden my horizons and enable me to develop a global perspective, which is increasingly important in our interconnected world.

Lastly, the university's strong network of industry partnerships and research collaborations is highly appealing. Being part of such a dynamic ecosystem will provide me with numerous opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research, collaborate with industry professionals, and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

In summary, the University of Waterloo stands out as an ideal choice for me due to its focus on practical education, cooperative programs, diverse community, and strong industry connections. I believe that studying there will provide me with a comprehensive and enriching educational experience, preparing me for a successful career in computer engineering.

## Ties to my home country

After completing my studies, I intend to use the knowledge and skills acquired during my studies in UWaterloo to contribute to the development and growth of my home country India. I have a strong desire to return to India for several compelling reasons. Firstly, my personal and familial ties to India are deeply rooted, as my entire family resides here. Being close to my loved ones and having the support of my family is of great importance to me, and it is a strong motivator for my decision to return.

Additionally, India's tech sector offers vast job opportunities and holds immense potential for growth. As one of the fastest-growing economies globally, India has become a prominent hub for technology and innovation. I am passionate about contributing to the tech ecosystem in India, as I believe it will have a far-reaching impact on various sectors, transforming industries and improving lives. Working in India's vibrant startup ecosystem would provide me with an exciting platform to make a meaningful difference and be part of the country's tech-driven growth.

The combination of personal ties and the thriving tech sector in India reinforces my conviction to return and build a fulfilling career while staying connected to my roots.

Yours Sincerely,
Yashashwin Karthikeyan
