# What are your biggest weaknesses?
- Not instantly out-going in a world where network is net-worth.
	- ==Reword==: I would describe myself as someone who may take a bit of time to warm up in social settings, but once I feel comfortable, I am able to actively participate and engage with those around me. I believe that building strong relationships and connections with others is important, and I am continuously working on improving my interpersonal skills to make the most out of every social interaction.
- Public speaking.
	- When it comes to public speaking, I see it as both a challenge and an opportunity. I understand that speaking in front of a large audience can be intimidating for many people, but I also believe that it is a valuable skill to have, both in personal and professional settings. To overcome my nerves and improve my public speaking abilities, I have taken courses and participated in workshops that have taught me how to effectively communicate my ideas, engage with my audience, and handle impromptu questions. In my previous experiences, I have found that preparation is key to successful public speaking. I take the time to research my topic thoroughly, practice my delivery, and anticipate potential questions or objections from my audience. Overall, I am confident in my ability to effectively communicate through public speaking, and I believe that this skill will be a valuable asset in my co-op program and future career.
