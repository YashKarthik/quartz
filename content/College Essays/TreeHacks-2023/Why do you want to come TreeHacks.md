TreeHacks attracts smart and ambitious builders from all over the world and fosters an atmosphere of "hell yeah, we can do this!". I want to meet these people and build cool stuff with them.

I want to meet these people who stay up late reading random blog posts about the history of QWERTY keyboards, these people who write drivers from scratch cuz "it's fun", these people who pre-learn linear algebra to build a 3D renderer; these people who...., idk man, these people who just have this intense drive in them and love to build things.

At TreeHacks, I wanna meet my old friends, from previous hackathons; friends with whom I wrote my first line of code, my first todo app, my first web scraper! And reminisce a little, maybe, about how far we've come.

I wanna come to TreeHacks to build cool things with super cool people.
