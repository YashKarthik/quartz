I would consider _Skimmr_ my standout project. It's a browser extension that uses GPT-3 to summarize and explain text, helping one understand complex writing.

The project is significant to my for several reasons: First, I got to use and play with exciting new technologies like language models, learn about browser extensions, API rate-limiting etc. Second, building Skimmr, I realized the power/potential of technology to solve problems that impact the world. 

The opportunity to learn and work with new tools and approaches has been very rewarding and hope to continue doing so at the Fellowship.
