There are two blockchain projects that I am particularly interested in building during the course of the fellowship.

The first project is a NFT based ticketing system for events and concerts. With this system, event organizers can create unique NFTs for each ticket and sell them to attendees. Since the ownership of NFTs is recorded on-chain, this could enable and lead to other spin-off events and exclusive perks.

The second project I am interested in building is an encrypted file-storage system on top of IPFS. The "vault" would be encrypted and accessible only via the user's Ethereum wallet. This system would function similar to Google Drive, but with the added censorship-resistant guarantees of a blockchain.
