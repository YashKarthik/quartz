Phones make us infinitely more connected with the world.

Graham Bell's telephone started us off by connecting us to people in our city. Nokia connected us to people in our country. iPhone took us to the world. And Instagram and TikTok connect us to worlds we don't even know. In this ever connected world, with phone screens in our faces all the time, we have become disconnected from the real world itself.

The future phone will get out of the way. It will be present; you'll still be able see your friend's latest story, but not at the expense of the current moment. The future is an AI-powered assistant that does EVERYTHING. It manages your calendar, your contacts, it's your secretary that screens calls and sets up meetings!

An AI wearable phone that connects you to the world, while letting you _stay_ connected with the real world.
