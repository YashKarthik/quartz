I truly believe that the two best ways to learn something are by doing/using that thing or by building that thing. I was literally just scrolling twitter before bed one sunday night and I saw some game devs arguing about something. I don’t even remember what they were arguing about, but that day I realized I had never done anything with computer graphics. In my mind it was one of those “hard tech” domains of software; grouped in with operating systems, kernels and stuff. And having learned C++ in my university course, I was also on the lookout for something exciting I could do with C++. So I figured why not go all-in and just build a 3d renderer from scratch without any libraries!

I finished the project literally two days ago. This project was incredible rewarding as I explored a new, "hard" domain with it and it exposed me to writing performant code to do the heavy-lifting that usually libraries would do.
