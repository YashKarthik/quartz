My maker-journey started in my school's robotics lab. Apart from relying on user- manuals, we banked on the internet for the latest updates.

As the pandemic boxed me in my home, I discovered an online community of makers–Hack Club. This community provided a wealth of resources–project ideas, tutorials, and help with my code.

I keep my making process simple & straightforward. After homing-on to an idea, I try to make a diagram to figure out the architecture. And then de-construct my project into small steps–a todo-list of checkpoints. I rely on my experience, documentation and online forums to guide my decisions.

My language of choice is TypeScript, paired with Vercel & Netlify for hosting. I open-source most of my work–GitHub is my Instagram. Coffee is my weapon of choice while MDN replaces Wikipedia for me.
