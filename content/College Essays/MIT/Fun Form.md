If you've ever worked with computers, you understand the diseaseâ€“the \*delight\* in being able to see how much you can do.

After submitting my first-year application to MIT, I have been learning and making.

Over the New Year's weekend, my friends at Hack Club and I, organized Asia's largest high-school hackathon(epoch.hackclub.com) with 200+ show-ups. It was a huge success and concluded with an awesome New Year's party.

Since then, I've learnt a new programming-language. My original intention was to study the Rust language, but I have shifted my focus to learning Huff instead. While I still plan to learn Rust in the future, my current focus on Huff will enhance my previous understanding of Ethereum and teach me its internal workings.

I have also been actively seeking job opportunities in the field of smart contract development and security. I am now excited to say that I am being interviewed for a Smart Contract Security role at a company called Sherlock.

Outside of Ethereum, I've been involved in the Farcaster.xyz community (a new social-network). Currently I'm building a web-app that visualizes the "social-graph" of the network. In the process, I've explored Graph Theory, modeling relationships, learnt how 3D graphics work in web browsers and the importance of caching.

Also, I've been working on a full redesign of my personal blog(yashkarthik.xyz). While I loved how it looked before, the redesigning process satisfies my inner-nerd, giving me time to experiment with unconventional layouts and new technologies.
