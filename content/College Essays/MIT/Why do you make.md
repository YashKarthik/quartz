1. The sheer joy of making things. As a kid gets excited about their sand castle, I have fun building things, especially things of my own design.
2. The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.
3. The fascination of creating complex machinery of interlocking moving parts and watching them work together, playing out the consequences of basic principles.
4. Coding is a form of expression, a way to express my ideas to computers, bringing them to life.
5. The joy of constant learning & the lightness of being a beginner is enhanced by the non-repeating nature of the task. In someway every problem is new, and I always learn something.
6. Programming is fun because it gratifies creative longings deep within myself.

I started programming because, from the outside, it seemed really cool & fun. I continue programming because it gives my the power to bring my ideas to life and make a tangible impact on the world around me (and also because it's still fun).

Coding is as a language like English. While English helps us communicate with other humans. Programming languages are a more verbose form of expression. Enabling me to express my ideas to computers and bringing them to life.

Coding allows me to express myself in a way that can solve actual problems.
