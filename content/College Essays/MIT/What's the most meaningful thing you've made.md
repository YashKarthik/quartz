The most meaningful thing I have ever made is a python web scraper. It was a simple program that downloaded all Xkcd comics and organized them on my computer.

While the project itself was relatively straightforward, I ran into a lot of bugs and errors. It was frustrating at times, but showed me all the sides of programmingâ€“the good and the bad. I eventually managed to fix the bugs though!

This project is significant, to me, for two reasons: First, it was my maiden software project, and made me fall in love almost instantaneously sparking off a lifelong interest in technology and programming. Second, it showed me the power/potential of technology to solve problems that impact the world. 

This simple web scraper was a key milestone in my maker-journey and continues to hold a special place in my memory.
