I have worked on diverse array of projects across different areas of CS. I've experimented with machine learning and data-science. While I enjoyed that, my interest shifted to web-development because I wanted to build user-oriented apps.

With each side-projects I try to solve a problem and understand a particular technology.

In my recent project–Skimmr.xyz–I played with serverless functions, familiarized myself with building browser extensions & finally managed to implement rate-limiting.

Over the summer, I built Breathe–a web app that alerts users of dangerous pollution levels. I learnt a lot about authentication & security while building this one.

With ETH Wrapped (in progress) I'm exploring various data-loading patterns for server-rendered React, learning about encoding-decoding blockchain data and figuring out NFT-minting.
