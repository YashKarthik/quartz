I spent my early childhood in the pristine cantonments of the Indian Army where there was abundance of greenery and space for me to play and learn. I learnt swimming, horse riding, air rifle shooting, golf and football, thanks to the amenities provided by the forces.

We moved every two years, which gave me an opportunity not only to explore the geography of our great country, but also, its rich culture, heritage, and value system. Before I turned 10, I had studied from the public schools of Jammu, Avadi, Bathinda, Allahabad, Patiala and Jhansi–all small towns. The constant moving taught me the skill adapt quickly and make the best of what I had.

When my dad transitioned into the corporate world, I also moved on to a boarding school in picturesque Nilgiris–The Lawrence School, Lovedale. I was thrilled with the variety of offerings–scholarly and extra curricular–at the school and dabbled in sports, music, aero-modeling, photography, painting, robotics and what have you! While I enjoyed most of the activities it was in the robotics lab that I experienced something that was magical. It didn't take me too long to realize where my true calling lay.

I believe, my multi-cultural upbringing has given me a unique perspective, a global outlook and a breadth of experiences that will enable me to excel at MIT.

One of the highlights of my childhood was the array of activities available to me, from swimming and horse riding, to air-rifle shooting and football. But it wasn't until I arrived at The Lawrence School, Lovedale in the picturesque Nilgiris that I truly found my passion. Initially,I was thrilled with the variety of offerings–scholarly and extra curricular–at the school and dabbled in sports, music, aero-modeling, photography, painting, robotics and what have you! After sampling widely and experimenting relentlessly, it was in the robotics lab, at my boarding school, that I experienced something truly magical and it didn't take me too long to realize where my true calling lay.

My multicultural upbringing has given me a unique perspective and a global outlook that has shaped my dreams and aspirations. I'm excited to bring this diverse background to MIT, where I believe I'll thrive thanks to the breadth of experiences I've had.
