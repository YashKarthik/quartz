August 2019, World Robot Olympiad Regional Level, Chennai.

The click-clack of LEGO plastic filled the auditorium as 600 teens raced against each other to build the robot each had designed in their labs. Each piece, each screw imprinted in my memory as I ticked-off a mental checklist of components and sub-components. 79 minutes later, we were among the first teams to finish assembling our bot.

It was like the math test you knew you'd ace. We had prepared for months, nailed every practice run and had a good night's sleep.

But just as our final demonstration round was about to begin, our gyroscopic sensor started malfunctioning. The readings from it were way out of the normal range. We recalibrated the sensor, rebooted the CPU and reloaded the program. But the sensor's readings remained faulty.
The sensor ended up costing us the National championship. 

Once back home, we researched online to understand what caused the malfunction. After a week of Googling, forum posts and emails to LEGO (they wrote back to 15-yr olds!) we figured that it was caused by a bug in the CPU firmware. Imagine writing your math test with invisible ink. After this experience, I began to explore relatively more robust robotics platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi which gave hackers like me end-to-end control over the platform. Thus began a new journey!
