Hey roomie,

First off, I'm absolutely pumped to live with you and start this new chapter together. We're probably not gonna meet until the orientation, so I figured I'd introduce myself in a.... Letter? Here’s some fun-facts about me:
-   I'm always down to stay up late to work p-sets with you. I’ll still drag you out of your bed at 5 AM for a run (curse my dad for that).
-   Whatever’s happening, there's always music in the background. Everything from Swift's latest to 80s metal (thank you Stranger Things)
-   Courtesy of my boarding school, I'm a fantastic ramen chef. I once even managed to cook it in a Tupperware bowl using just hot water from the water purifier.
-   I love showering in boiling hot water. Gotta kill the bacteria!
-   I can't wait for crinkled clothes to become a trend so I can stop ironing them.
-   I'm a huge mechanical keyboard nerd. I'm sure I’ll talk you into using them (unless you already use one, in which case I’d love to mix-n-match keycaps).

Writing this, I’m already missing my not-so-friendly fights with my brother. Get your pillow ready, the fight for the tv-remote is on!

Lastly, I feel so humbled to be surrounded by incredible, passionate people like you. I'm looking forward to hearing more about you and getting to know you better.

See you soon :)
