One time my friend and I had to clean the robotics lab after a night of intense brainstorming. Rather than sweeping and sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us. I knew how transformative technology is. It has been all around us. But actually using it to automate (+make fun) a mundane task was when I truly _grokked_ the power of technology.

After seeing the potential of technology, I wanted to take it further and introduce more people to this superpower. As I stood there, thinking of the ways to improve club, my mind wandered back to when I was six, learning to swim. My parents were very insistent, they even drove me to swimming-classes everyday for two months!

To make robotics more accessible, we convinced our club-advisor (computer-science teacher) to give some talks, seminars on introductory topics. Despite doing this, every Friday, for almost two months, we didn't gain much traction.

My two-month-long swim-class concluded after what felt like an entire year, but my swimming skills.... I could float, but wouldn't dare submerging me head. But going to the pool everyday for over two months, I'd made some friends. They were a little older than me and already knew swimming (one guy could even jump from the highest diving-board!). Before long I was splashing in the pool, playing Marco-Polo and having a great time. My fear of water had somehow vanished.

Connecting the dotsâ€¦. I realized that the person giving the seminars, should be _relatable_ to the new members. It should've been us, not our club-advisor, conducting classes.

The new workshops were an instant hit, and before long we had a thriving community learning from each other. It was like a flywheel, with the new members teaching others and creating a network effect that helped everyone learn and grow.
