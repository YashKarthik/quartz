Hey Evan, hows it going.
Im Yash. im a freshman at waterloo and want to build impactful tech.

I really like programming (github.com/yashkarthik). my biggest skill is learning new things _very_ quickly (built a rasterizer from scratch without libraries in c++ over the winter break etc)

I saw that sfcompute is hiring. I'd love to work for you this summer!
Best,Â 
Yash

# Reading Inbox
- The Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering
- How to by Xkcd

# Projects
- React Native ebook reader.
- App that reminds you when your friends are in town.
- Play with open interpretter.
- Linked notes became popular cuz they are supposed to help you see your knowledge accrue over time. Manual linking is added friction. I just wanna hit CMD+N and start typing whatever's on my mind. I don't care (right now) which folder my file is in or which tags it's been connected. I just want to type it out. AI should do the connecting and stuff like that in the background for me, helping me relate stuff to what I've previously written.
# Writing
