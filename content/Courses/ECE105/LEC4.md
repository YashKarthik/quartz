- Basically solved a lot of problems.
- Used equations of motion in the context of vertical motion.
- Ignoring air resistance, vert motion has constant acceleration $g$.

$$
\begin{align}
y = u_yt + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
v_y = u_y + gt
\end{align}
$$
(choice of coordinates will affect $\pm$ of $g, y, v_y$)
