- Studied motion with constant acceleration.
- Velocity changes by the same amount per unit time.
- Equations of motion.

Since acceleration is constant, we can make some assumptions about it.
$$
\begin{aligned}

a = \text{const} \\
a = a_{avg} \\
a = \frac{v - u}{t} \\
v = u + at

\end{aligned}
$$

## Position
Area under a v-t curve.

- Area of Rectangle + area of triangle
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
(always a parabola cuz of $t^2$).
