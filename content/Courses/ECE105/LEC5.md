- Motion in 3D.
- We consider each of the components of motion separately.
	- When taking derivative, each component is operated on separately.
- Motion in 3D is basically a superposition of motion on each of the individual axes.
# Acceleration on a curved path
- Acceleration is tangential to path only in 1D motion.
- On a curved path (2D), the velocity vector is changing with time.
	- The magnitude may remain same but the direction of the vector is changing.
- Since velocity is changing, there is acceleration (that's the definition).
- Velocity is always tangential to the trajectory (instantaneous).
- If we draw the diagrams and look at the change in velocity, the $\Delta$ is always _toward_ the inside.
- Hence, acceleration on a curved path always points towards the inside of the curve.
