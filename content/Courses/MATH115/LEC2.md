# Complex Conjugate
$$
\begin{align}
z = x + yj \\
\bar z = x - yj
\end{align}
$$
We literally just flip the sign of $y$.
## Division
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{w}{z} = w\cdot\frac{1}{z} \\\\
\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{z}\cdot\frac{\bar z}{\bar z} \\\\
= \frac{1}{x+yj}\cdot\frac{x - yj}{x - yj}\\\\
= \frac{x - yj}{x^2 + y^2}\\\\

\\
\implies \frac{w}{z} = w\cdot\frac{(x - yj)}{x^2 + y^2}
\end{align}
$$

# Exponents
Very tedius (I think we will learn about this again with polar representations.)
$$
z^k = z(z^{k-1});\ \ k \ge 0
$$
# Modulus
$$
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$
- For real numbers modulus is equal to the absolute value.
- Absolute values is kinda weird in complex numbers.
- Modulus represents the magnitude for complex numbers (think like in vectors).
- We can't compare complex numbers directly, but we can compare their magnitude.
	- The result of comparing magnitudes do not apply to the complex numbers themselves.
 
# Complex Plane
- Thinking more in vectors.
- $(x,y)$ is a coordinate on the Cartesian Plane.
- $x+yj$ too represents a point on the Complex Plane.

- Instead of x, y axes, we have the real and imaginary axes.
- $x, y$ represent magnitude on their respective axis and $|z|$ gives us the magnitude.
- Now operations like addition etc are _very_ similar to vector operations using diagrams.
