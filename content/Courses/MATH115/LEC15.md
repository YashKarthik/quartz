# Outline
- Underdetermined systems:
	- A system of $m$ equations in $n$ variables is underdetermined if $n\gt m$.
	- Since there are more columns than rows, some column will end up without a pivot => existence of free parameters.
	- When we have free params, we have infinite solutions.
- Overdetermined systems:
	- A system of $m$ equations in $n$ variables is underdetermined if $n\lt m$.
	- Since there are more rows than columns, some columns will end up with more than one pivot.
	- Most overdetermined systems are inconsistent.
- Homogeneous Systems of Linear Equations.
