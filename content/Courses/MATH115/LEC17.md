# Outline
- $A_{m\times n}$ is a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.
- Matrices are equal if each of their corresponding entries are equal.
- If $m = n$, we have a square matrix.
- Addition of matrices: just like vectors, corresponding entries are summed up.
- Scalar multiplication of matrices: like vectors, each entry is multiplied with the scalar multiple.
- Transpose of $A_{m\times n}$ is $A^T_{n\times m}$. Rows become columns, and cols become rows.
	- $(A^T)^T = A$
	- $(A+B)^T = A^T + B^T$
	- $(cA)^T = cA^T$
- Symmetric matrices. If $A^T = A \implies n = m$. (not vice versa)
