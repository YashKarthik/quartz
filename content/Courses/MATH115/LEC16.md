# Outline
- Homogeneous linear equation is a linear equation where the RHS is zero.
- $\vec 0$ is a trivial solution to the system.
- The are always consistent (cuz we always have $\vec 0$ as a solution).
- $[A | \vec 0]$ is the associated homogeneous system of $[A | \vec b]$.
- We get a system of equations we "read off" from $[A|\vec 0]$, this is a homogenous system of equations.
- Setting the free param to zero, we get a "particular/trivial solution" to the system.
- This is like point $\vec p$ of the line. All the other points on the line are basically linear combinations of this one solution.

- Matrix Algebra basics.
