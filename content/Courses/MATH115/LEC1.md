- Numbers systems
- Definition, standard form of complex numbers
- Operations on complex numbers.

# Number Systems
- We already have a bunch of number systems.
- $C$ is another one.

# Complex Number

$$
\begin{align}
x^2 + 1 = 0 \\
\implies x = \sqrt{-1}
\end{align}
$$

The equation has no read solutions. It does not touch the x-axis.

We define $j$ such that $j^2 = -1$.
$$
\implies j^2 +1 = 0
$$
That equation is literally the definition of $j$â€“the imaginary number.

# Standard Form
$$
\begin{align}
x + yj \\\\
C = \{\ x + yj\ |\ x, y \in R, j^2 = -1\  \}
\end{align}
$$

## Every Real number is a Complex number
$$
\begin{align}
x = x +0 \\
0 = 0j \\
\implies x = x + 0j \\
\implies x \in C
\end{align}
$$
If we set the imaginary part to zero, we get a purely real number. If we set the real part to zero, we can a purely imaginary number (like $2j$).

Notation:
$$
\begin{align}
z = x + yj\\
Re(z) = x\\
Im(z) = y
\end{align}
$$

# Operations on Complex Numbers
- Add (corresponding terms)
- Sub (corresponding terms)
- Multiply (open the brackets dude)
- [[Courses/MATH115/LEC2#Division|Division]] is same as multiplying with the inverse.

- Inverse can be found by multiplying numerator and denominator by the [[Courses/MATH115/LEC2#Complex Conjugate|complex conjugate]].
