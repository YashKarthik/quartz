- [[Evergreen/Span and Spanning Sets|Span and Spanning Sets]]
- Theorem 24.1: [[Evergreen/How Span relates to Consistency of Matrix-Vector Product|How Span relates to Consistency of Matrix-Vector Product]]
- The Span of vectors describes geometric things!?
	- Eg: The span of a single vector describes a line with that said vector as the direction vector and passing through origin.
	- Span of two vectors gives us a plan through origin.
	- Span of three vectors gives us all of $R^3$.
