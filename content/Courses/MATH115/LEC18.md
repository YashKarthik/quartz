# Outline
- We've used augmented matrices to solve linear equations.
- [[Evergreen/How to represent linear systems as matrix-vector equations|How to represent linear systems as matrix-vector equations]]
- [[Evergreen/Matrix-Vector Product|Matrix-Vector Product]]
- Properties of Matrix-Vector Product.
	- This product also behaves similarly to the regular real number product.
- Identity matrix. Product with this gives back the original vector.
