- Complex Polynomials.
- Theorem for Real Polynomials.

# Complex Polynomials
Polynomials with complex coefficients. (to be solved the same way).

# Theorem for Real Polynomials
For a real polynomial $p(x)$, if $w$ is a root of $p(x)$, $\overline w$ is also a root of $p(x)$

- Proof in next lecture.
