# Review
- "Instrumental" discourse.
	- Discourse that accomplishes something.
- Hard news v soft news.
	- Hard news: important, fact based.
	- Soft news is less important but could be interesting.
- Advertisement vs advertorial.
	- Advertisement promotes product through media, obviously.
	- Advertorial is ideology that promotes the product.
	- Advertorial promotes stuff under a facade of a review.
# Citations for Reading Analysis
- We use IEEE.
- For citations with missing information, write a note about that.
- Evidence can be description, paraphrasing etc.
- Evidence should be cited.
- We are not to review the work's quality.
- We are to focus on the content and form.

Example:
- Recipe's form is the bullet points and short concise instructions.
- Content is the actual instructions themselves.
# Genre Sets: Analyzing New Genres
- Genres have certain structural and rhetorical conventions.
- Genre conveys the presentation, goal and functions of text.
- Genres like fiction, non-fic are too broad to convey meaningful information.

## Analyzing Guide:
- Focus on style.
	- sentence length, complexity, word choice, paragraph length.
	- sentence type: declarative, imperative, interrogative.
- Focus on structure.
	- content organization, divs of sections, content in each section.
	- org patterns: chronological, reverse chrono, general info to specific info, specific to general, hourglass (general to specific to general).
	- organizational markers:
	- Topic sentences; their explicitness, location; 
		- transitional elements (signposting). How are they transitioning? Using "furthermore, thus, hence", or using headings.
		- Introductory elements (abstract, summary, intro).
		- Summary elements (conclusion, list of key points, summary).
- Focus on register (diction, tone, voice).
	- formality of language, use of contractions like "isn't" and the use of "I".
	- Calculate percentage of contractions vs total words.
	- Level of language (count the technical jargon, normal words, academic words and calculate percentages).
	- When is jargon used.
	- Register tells us the target audience

- For technical writing, "user" is a more accurate term rather than audience.
- Types of users and what kind of information does each user type need.
	- basic, novice, experienced, advanced, expert.
