- Talks about importance of metals and minerals in the development of humankind and nation.
- Gives brief background of lithium and rising importance in power grid, economy, life.
- Steel powered the 20th century, lithium could power the 21st.

- Potentially the largest lithium deposits discovered in Nevada.
- Could give US a giant leg-up in the global technological arms race.

- China has had a head-start in the lithium race.
	- They have discovered deposits northeast of Tibet, invested in lithium from Bolivia, Australia, Chile.
	- The Nevada lithium could counter-balance this availability of lithium, but actually using that lithium will take time.
