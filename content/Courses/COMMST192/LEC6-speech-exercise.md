Late winter night. You've been grinding away for hours on that physics problem. The initial excitement for that simple looking problem, has worn away by now. And the drowsiness is kicking in.

What do you reach for? A cup of coffee.

And you're not alone! Some of the greatest minds of history, from Albert Einstein to Voltaire drank coffee. In fact, Voltaire drank 40 cups of coffee each day.

And they might have been onto something. Coffee, it turns out, is actually quite usefulâ€“in moderation of course. According to Healthline, coffee improves brain health, promotes better weight management and boosts energy levels, giving you that late night kick to finish the 105 assignment.
