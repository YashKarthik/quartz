Been a while since I journaled. Some days I write a lot about how I'm feeling in the moment. That's why I use time as a subheading. Right now, I'm feeling tired, sleepy combined with some regret for wasting my morning. I skipped run and had a really good sleep. But after that, my schedule collides with the rest of the world. Ugh.

I should probably look into journalling prompts.
