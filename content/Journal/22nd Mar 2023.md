The day started dreadfully. I snoozed the alarm thinking it would ring again, but it had already rung thrice. But in those fifteen minutes until my dad came to my door, I had a really killer dream. We were on a train, in a post zombie outbreak worldâ€“I don't know if it was zombie, but some infected thing. Having to wake me up was what probably fucked up my dad's mood. I walked outside from 6.30 to 7.15 and then dropped off Vivi and then when I came back home, he chased me out. I walked around outdoors for another hour and read a bit of Goblet of Fire. I don't know if this is some cosmic coincidence or what but Harry was having a bad day in the book. The worst part about "adulting" is the time it takes away from really useful work. There should be robots for this! I went for my driving class then. I still can't believe that we, as a society, just let people hurtle around in two-tonne heavy cages of metal, with some fake idea of control. Self-driving cars are **definitely** safer. I can't trust myself driving these things, how tf am I supposed to trust that 15 year old. And who in devil's name program's government websites. I can't fucking download this certificate from Red Cross and I need to get it printed for my license. What junk. It's using some Microsoft junk called `.aspx` which itself is a pre-cursor to .NET. Ancient trash.
