I wasn't planning on going to the gym today, cuz Sunday. But my dad basically forced me to. I hate it when my plans get wrecked because of some stupid veto shit. Gym was fine, but now I lost an hour. I'm gonna do some sat practice, some essay stuff and then after lunch work on breathe app.

The fiddly-ness around coding new things is fun, but it's also a huge early rut. It makes it hard, mentally, to start.

Did some math practice.

My dad went ballistic, on vivi. It's.... honestly boring and useless now. It is scary in the moment yeah, but he's not there to enforce whatever he says during the rage. He binary in this sense. Either he is just silent while we complain, or he goes nuclear on vivi. It's just not working. Vivi needs to be taught, but not by going ballistic on him.
