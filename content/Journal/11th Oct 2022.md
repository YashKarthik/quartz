I wasn't expecting my trainer to be in gym today. He was. It was a good workout. Winter's coming.

I was planning on writing my essay first thing in the morning. But I checked my telegram, discord, notion and I then ended working on the Farcaster post. Someone had left some comments and suggestions. I fixed them and now I don't feel like writing my essay. I think I'll do some coding for Frencaster and then write the essay in the afternoon.

Coding sesh went well. I love people building all these nifty tools that are super useful in programming. Eg: converting JSON to a Typescript interface. Super useful.
