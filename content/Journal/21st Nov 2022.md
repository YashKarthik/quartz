Choosing a major is such a significant decision. It affects almost everything that can't be reversed. And unless you're crazy/bold, you're stuck doing that thing for the rest of your life. I at least have it sorta figured out. But don't know which version of cs to go into. Also, unis that don't put cs under the CoE or a school of computing are just mad. I'm kinda torn between various levels of hardware courses. Theres CS, CE, EECS. They're all pretty much the same but with varying amounts of cs and ec courses. I think I'm gonna go with CS as a safe bet, if I wanna do more hardware I'll do via electives. I haven't read anything in a while. There's jus so much I'm interested in.
