Today is gonna be different. I'm doing writing first thing in the morning. Hopefully I'm able to actually follow through. There's just so much on my plate right now. Whatever I do, I'm missing something. There's a lot of stuff happening too. One side is stuff I'm interested in. The tech, the innovation the future! The other side is stuff I need to do. SAT, essay, college.

I know that I should not open social media early in the morning. I know that I should do my own writing in the morning. When I follow stuff like this, the day works great. But it's hard to follow. Or something like that. It's a case of poor self-discipline and (i guess) shiny-object-syndrome. Writing is peaceful.
