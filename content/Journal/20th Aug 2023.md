Shopping is pretty much done. I've received my blanket, it's cool. I received the backpack. The yellow is so dirty; it looks like my shit. We returned it, gonna look for a new one today in CP.

The WARG bootcamp was really tough man. There was no starting point, it was hard to understand the problem itself if you've never done embedded. But after I figured out how to read and write data from the ADC, it wasn't too hard. It was fun overall.

Bought a pretty good backpack. It's grey, has an uncommon style of external pockets, has a decent number of pockets inside and some nice padding for the laptop. I also got a cover for my Pixel. Makes it a little thicker, but I'm much more comfortable taking it out now.

Haven't read much in a while. It makes picking up a book harder, reminds me of [[People/Stephan Ango]]'s note on [[Evergreen/Actions create motivation|nibbling]]. I should start nibbling the book, to drive interest in it and motivation to read it.
