I realized how much time gets wasted standing in line. Not just literal lines like grocery stores and toll booths, but even waiting in line for the bathroom. That's the problem with doing things at the same time that others do stuff. I have 6 months, I should experiment with alternate routines. It'll probably be useful in college.
