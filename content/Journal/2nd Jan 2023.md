The hackathon was awesome. The best part was the exhibition and meeting people and their cool projects. I'm optimistic about the future of humanity.

Today's been a reasonably chill day. I published a blog post and watched a movie.

I'm planning to finish all college related stuff tomorrow so that I can start building and reading next.
