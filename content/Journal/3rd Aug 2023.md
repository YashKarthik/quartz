Today felt different. I woke up, but managed to skip gym cuz I had a meeting late last night. After that I got Vivi set up for class and stuff like that.

I revised some math, linear inequalities and the wavy curve method. It's been a while since I wrote some notes. I'm gonna research some design teams now.

This hit me like a brick yesterday:

I was browsing the web, looking for good ereader apps. I don't need many features. A clear UI, basic highlighting and privacy. There's literally no app that checks all the boxes! It was pretty shit. Then I realized. I could build one. Being a programmer changes your philosophy around problems.
