I honestly don't know what I did yesterday. I finally announced that I'm going to Waterloo on Farcaster. And I think I wasted the rest of the morning on the dopamine high. After lunch we went shopping and bought two simple t-shirts. Shit's expensive man. I need to lay everything down and ensure that I actually have everything I need.

I'm going to Hosur tomorrow. Gonna meet some bangi guys too. Ugh, why did I agree. I'm hating it now but I'll be glad I met them.

My sleep schedule hasn't recovered yet. It's all cause of that one night we went and chilled at marine drive. And now I can't wake up early, and when I do wake up, my head feels like a lead box. It'll hopefully reset itself after bangi. Because of this sleep fuckup I can't even read properly.

Also what the fuck should I do with my hair man. Am I keeping it long cuz I like it long or because most people have it short.
