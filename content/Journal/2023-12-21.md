Moved into the Airbnb last night. So far no problem. The room is reasonably comfy the owners keep to themselves so pretty private too I guess. I haven't yet gone up though and I need to figure out my food situation. I realized I have access to the kitchen so I'll prolly have cereal and bread for breakfast. For my second meal, I'll prolly have to do the tiffin service. For the first couple days though I'm gonna go there and check it out. Later on I guess I could order it here.

I was talking to my mom the other day, turns out I never mentioned that I was booking an Airbnb. They assumed that I was staying at SJ over the break. And she was so surprised. I think if I'd mentioned it earlier, they would've basically called me back. Would've been nice to get away from Waterloo. This weather so depressing.

I need to get my schedule back on track. I wake up at like 2 pm and stay up till 4. Very unhealthy. I'm gonna fix my sleep, start working out and get out of the house too. I should explore the city a bit. I need to do some shopping too. I should make a list of things I wanna do over the breakâ€“and get to it! I should reach out to the uwstartup folks too, I doubt they're doing nothing over the hols; though they might be doing something from home. But still, hang out over the internet or something.

Basically, sleep well, workout, get out of the house, and talk to people.

Bro I haven't written in so long. I should write about this term. Soon that too, before I forget.
