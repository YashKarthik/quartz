I forgot to keep the iPad in my room last night. The alarm rang but I didn't hear it cuz it was ringing in the living room. I got up a little later and had to instantly get out to go to the gym.

Gym was fun. My trainer was there and I did shoulder workout. It's good when he's there. My arms basically died. I came back home just in time to take Vivi to the school. He was scared of missing the bus and was in some real hurry.

Today's main thing was finishing off the brag sheet and stuff. I did that and kinda wanted to chill. So I figured I'd do some productive chilling and worked on figuring out my obsidian workflow. For tasks basically I'm gonna write them in my daily note and use queries to consolidate them into a single file.
