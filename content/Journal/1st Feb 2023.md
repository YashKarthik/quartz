It's a Wednesday, but feels like a Monday. Probably because it's 1st Feb, so it feels like the start of another "time section". It's wild, already 4 weeks of this year are done. It feels so long, yet so short. It feels like it's been months since the Epoch hackathon, but I feel weird that Jan went by so quickly. I did a good amount of coding in Jan. Progress on my coding goals? Massively upgraded in solidity. So that's good. Haven't done any Go or Auth stuff though.

The fact that our time is limited is the scariest and the most urgent reminder to do what you love.
