This is my first physical hackathon and I think it's going pretty well. I've found a team and somehow found the courage to talk to anyone. That's the crazy part. Wow. This is a pretty good result of this hackathon. Hackathons are really not about coding, they're about using coding as an excuse to meet new people.

My team is pretty useless though. They hardly know coding. But I'm fine with it.

I'm gonna be attending a lot of hackathons in the next six months.

The level of programmers in a hackathon is relatively low though. Like the people in my circles on twitter and other stuff are pretty smart. Way ahead of me. Here I'm not so dumb. I think it's because many people come to hackathons to get a taste and have fun. There are lots of really smart kids too. Like 11 year olds. I think this weekends gonna be fun.

Today's the main day of coding. I need to get my fucking API keys. But I'm stuck in the lounge without internet.
