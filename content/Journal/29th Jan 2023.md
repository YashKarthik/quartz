My legs are dead. Had a good workout, and chilled after for a while.

GTech, UIUC, and UMich all came out. It's been mostly a bloodbath in the hack club slack. Even geniuses like Dev didn't get into UIUC. How tf am I gonna get in. Looks like my best chance is Purdue. I know I shouldn't compared and stuff, but these guys have way better ECs and also applied early. March is gonna be a mad month.

I've been redesigning my website for the past two weeks now. I can't decide shit. Took me long enough to settle on fonts and stuff.

Haven't been read that much this week. I really need to follow my schedule, even the reading part. I just like coding so much that it spills over to the afternoon. And once I start coding, I just cannot stop. Along with reading, I should give myself more time for writing too.

Ethernaut's been going well though. I'm able to to solve and understand the problems. I think I should be done by the end of this week.
