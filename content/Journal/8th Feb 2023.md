My workouts are going pretty well this week. I still haven't gotten my post-workout routine settled though. I still have to do the Waterloo interview. I really like using the couch while I'm on my laptop, but it's in the middle of the house, so it's always super noisy. I still have haven't shipped my blog. I'm making progress on Solidity, but there's also a lot to learn. Dapp development has lot of things other than solidity. I need to tweet more and be more active in discords. I'm gonna be more active in Theo's discord and the Astro discord; both are pretty fun places to hang out and answer questions. I should look for something similar in the crypto space too. I'm reasonably active in the Farcaster telegram, but there aren't too many questions there. I figure I could do something surrounding ENS and be active in that discord. Anyway, the goal is to be on top of people's minds when they think of frontend, solidity, and these in-between apps.
