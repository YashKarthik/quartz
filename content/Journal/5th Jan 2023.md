I started reading Neuromancer yesterday. It's one of the most praised sci-fi books and I'm pretty excited to read it. I read like 20 pages and... kinda struggled. My reading skills have deteriorated or this is a tough book. It's weird cuz I read tons of blogs and articles and they all use simple language. But books, books use beautiful language–and that's good–so I need to get used to it and improve my reading.
