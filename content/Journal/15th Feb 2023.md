Ever since the kidney stone issue, back in Chennai, my dad's been weaker. Not physically–he's probably the fittest 55 year old–mentally, I think. He's always got doom and gloom when he would have his yearly vomiting episodes, but now he gets tensed at even the slightest sign of physical weakness. There was the cancer scare too in the middle, and many people have died in the family. Once death touches someone you know, you can never be the same. Now he get's tensed if his BP is higher than 110, he gets tensed before the measurement, so the measurement is already high! And he's really not much of a talker, so I dunno what to say to him.
