I fucked up. Need to take the sat again. And my parents are having second thought about US.

The SAT is pretty much my fault. I could've focused down and finished it in one go. But I chose to split my efforts and now I need do it over. It feels terrible.

I don't understand my parents reconsidering the entire US college stuff.

I hope everything works out.

My discipline is pretty shit. That's another thing I need to get together.

I'm gonna take the TOEFL sample test tomorrow and see how much I need to work on that. I hope it's not much.

I need to figure out my sleep stuff too. Half of my unproductive stuff is cuz of being sleepy. Like right now I wanna write stuff, but I'm just too sleepy to write anything.
