It's Saturday. 1B is about to start.

I move back tomorrow. Today I'm planning on going to Walmart, buy some supplies for the term.

These twenty days went by so quick. I did a fair bit of work. I also wasted a lot of time. I could've chilled more.

I forgot to write about this: meem's def not into me.

We texted before new year's a bit and last I wrote, I was waiting for her reply. She liked my message and left it. That was kinda sad and it would've been awkward if I said hi after such an interaction. So just to get it over with, I texted her suggesting we should build a project together. Sent another text saying it's fine if she doesn't remember–basically gave her no excuse to not  do it unless she really doesn't want to. But she actually managed to say no, politely and quickly without leading on. She said that 1B's gonna be hell and stuff. It's actually good she said no early on. I'm pretty sure she would've figure out I liked her. So instead of being a friend and leading me on, she just said no–so noble.

Anyway that was the start of the year. A little sad–I'm still not over her. But glad I'm not going into 1B with delusions. I shouldn't fantasize too much, just go for it.

I started applying to jobs. It's so tedious. And kinda hopeless and scary.
