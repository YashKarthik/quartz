I have no idea how I wasted half of today. Literally doing nothing.

Gym was pretty good, I liked the intensity. I should do gym -> swim straight one day. Wash off all the sweat from gym into the pool and come out fresh. After gym I slept though. For a while, not too long. I waste a lot of time between tasks. It's already 1 and I haven't done anything useful. I think I'm gonna setup my finance stuff now.
