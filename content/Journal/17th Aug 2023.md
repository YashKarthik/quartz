I need to actually start studying some math before school.

I'm also trying to figure out my general day-schedule for uni.

## 11:41
Created a balanced, sustainable schedule for uni.

---
# General Schedule
- Approx Timings: 08:30 - 16:30 (only Monday 17:30)
## Mornings
- Mornings have a mix of labs, tuts and lectures.
- Time-blocks are usually larger in the morning (1.5 - 2.5 hrs)
- Breaks between classes are usually around 1 hr (but range from 10 min to 3 hrs)
## Afternoons
Consider it one big block of lectures/tuts.
- Afternoons are only tuts, lecs.
- Each block is usually 1 hr.
- 10 minutes between each block.
# Final Schedule
- Swim in the morning
	- 7-8 (out of PAC by 8)
	- Sleep by 11.
	- Breakfast done by 8
- Classes
	- Use breaks to do assignments, revise.
	- Use longer breaks for projects / design teams.
- Lunch (run!)
- Classes
	- Hardly any break, so chill between them.
- Gym / chill / projects / design team (not school work since I just got back from classes)
- Dinner
- Work for 4 hours.
# Draft Schedules: Early
## Sleep, early wake up, 2x physical
- Use breaks between morning classes for assignments, revisions.
- Use larger breaks for design team / projects.
- Gym in morning.
	- Need to be showered by 8, since 8.30 classes.
	- => Gym over by 7.40 => gym starts by 6.40 => wake up at 6.15 => sleep by 22.
- Swim after classes, right before dinner (skip Monday)
	- Swim 17.00 -> 18.00.
	- Dinner done by 19.00.
- 3 hrs Design team / school work after dinner.

- Pros: balanced (2x physical), workout in the morning is fresh.
- Cons: requires early sleep (uni wakes up at night), can be disturbed easily.
## Late sleep
- Sleep by 12 => wake up 8, straight to class.
- School work between classes.
- Gym after classes, before dinner (swim only on weekends). Or alternate between them.
- Solid 5 hours of Design team / school work after dinner.
	- Enough time for multiple subjects / design team on most days.

- Pros: doesn't require early sleep, solid block of time for work, probably more sustainable.
- Cons: slightly less physical activity, no workout in morning (less fresh i think).

## Other customizations
- Alternate between gym and swim in the morning.
	- Need to find something else to do before dinner, after class.
	- And I won't need to wake up as early as it's either cardio or workout not both.
	- 6.45 wake up will be enough for gym day, 7 for swim day => sleep by 10.45.
- In the 2x, swim in the morning => I can wake up by 7 (sleep by 11) and still be ok.
	- Decent sleep time
	- Good amount of physical activity (both swim and gym)
	- 4 hours of work at night.
- Swim / gym between classes
	- Less crowd.
	- I can sleep at 12.
	- My normal schedule has study during classes.
