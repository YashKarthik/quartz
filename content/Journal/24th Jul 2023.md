Overall I think it was a good decision to do AoC in C. I discovered quickly that C lacks a lot of the niceties that I've taken for granted in py, js and go. I'm starting to understand why solidity has some of these quirks too.

The CS50 teacher is soo good. He's next level passionate and a really good story teller / explainer. I'm about to start his lecture on memory and yeah it's gon be fun.

Finished his memory video and then also vid on data structures. Not sure if I'm gonna program today, I'm really tired, I'm gonna kill AoC tomorrow.
