I'm almost done with my applications. Just need to finish editing the video for Maker Portfolio and some other random stuff. After finishing applications, I'm planning on doing these fellowships. They're kinda like internships, but under a mentor, and usually involve contributing to open-source. I really hope I get into one of these colleges.
