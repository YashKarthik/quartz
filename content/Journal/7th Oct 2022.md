So i'm kinda contemplating switching to Obsidian or Logseq for managing my notes. It all started a couple of weeks ago. YouTube started recommending me a lot of Prime's videos. And I was really amazed at the stuff he was doing and the general state of Lua in Neovim. So I thought why don't I head back to vim and see how it is, then come back to Emacs. But.... vim is really snappy. It's just way smoother than emacs. Emacs might be slow because I'm running it on macOS, but still. Vim was just awesome. Also, Lua brought its extensibility on par with Emacs, and Elisp is just hard. So now I'm back in vim for writing code. The only thing I used emacs for was writing notes, and today it crashed on me. Yeah that's all.

I downloaded a setup some basic stuff in Obsidian today. Probably the only downside is the extra clicking and mousing I need to do to get around stuff. Being keyboard driven is super powerful.
