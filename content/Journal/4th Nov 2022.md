# Journal
## 11:00
Haven't journaled in more than a week. I realize, I don't journal when I go down the unproductive spiral. I spent most of my time the past two weeks watching shit.

I watched a Ted-Ed video that explained that procrastination is kinda like fight or flight. The brain basically is scared of the upcoming task and flights by taking a break from stuff. And it reduces the short-term stress.
