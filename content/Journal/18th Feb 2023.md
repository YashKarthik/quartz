Now that my Waterloo interview is done, there's really nothing left for me to do. Now it's stuff I _want_ to do.

I spent yesterday going the Go tour. It's a pretty simple language. Its type system is not as good as TypeScript, then again I haven't really explored TS's deeply, just enough to get my work done. I've gone through the basics, next I'm gonna go through a web-focused course for Go. Hopefully by the evening I'll be comfortable using Go, then I can start building ENScan tomorrow.
