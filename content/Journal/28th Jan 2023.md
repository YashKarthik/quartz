I had a weirdly dream last night. Great sleep; but weird dream. I don't remember it obviously, but I remember the feeling. Now I've forgotten the feeling too.

Now I'm almost done with all colleges. Literally three things remainingâ€“Pitt submission, Waterloo interview and MIT Fun form. Out of them, the interview probably requires the most preparation. So there's that.

I'm really liking the Ethernaut challenges. And I'm no longer as scared of solidity as before. There's still a **lot** in solidity to learn, but I think I've got the basics down. The other side of this stuff, Dapp dev, I did the challenge 0 in the speed-run series. I'm just more interested in solidity right now.
