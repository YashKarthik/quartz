Midterm season is crazy. Last term I remember basically not studying between midterms. The results were basically only because of reading week. I planned to do that this time too. Cuz I figured I'd be dead each day after midterms. But this time I have probably done equal if not more studying between the exams too. Maybe this time it's cuz I _have_ too! Or I just have more energy (would be crazy if it's this reason) or maybe it's cuz I'm okay with learning and grinding one night before the exam and not getting 8 hours before the exam. I haven't got my marks yet, but I have a feeling this term's midterms are going better.

It's crazy though, how time passesâ€“already half the term's over!

I keep coming back to the same thing: I need to make more friends, especially women! I should probably actually get my shit together about this. Like sit down and analyze.

1. Where do people meet more people.
	1. Dorm.
	3. Class.
	2. Clubs.
	3. Library?
2. Striking up conversations.
3. Smiling more (this is probably half of it).
4. Talking to pseudo-acquintances (eg: ppl in my class, we're both in the same class, we should know each other, we know that we're both in the same class and recognize each other but don't really talk or know each others' names). This is probably the worst category.

I'm just a unconfident pussy.

This spontaneous, middle of the week journalling feels good. I think I'm partly doing this cuz I haven't typed much in a very long time.
