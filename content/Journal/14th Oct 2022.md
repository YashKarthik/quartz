The day is starting out slowly. My morning schedule is too dependent on others. It starts out fine, I get up and go for run. But once I'm back home, that's when it goes to shit. I've to go drop vivi, that takes up a solid 20 min. That's fine. But when I get back, I've to build my routine around my dad's breakfast, ironing clothes and a bunch of other things. It's **painfully slow**. I need to figure something out. Also I should probably start sleeping for about half an hour in the afternoon. I need to decide how I'm gonna keep the rejuvenation alive since I'd have to get vivi from the bus stop right after I wake up. Would that cancel out my sleep?
