I can't wait to be done with these college applications. The past couple of days I've been researching Waterloo and it's really nice. This happens with pretty much every school I research, but I've got a bunch of extra reasons for Waterloo. Honestly, the only schools that would beat it are MIT, Stanford, (maybe) Cornel and Berkeley. There are a lot of guys I know from crypto-twitter at Waterloo. In fact, that's also where Vitalik studied before dropping out. It's really great. And produced a lotta YC material. Also, it's way cheaper than anything comparable. I'm gonna finish applying to it today.

Submitted Waterloo. Did a couple of Ethernaut challenges too. It's fun. Now need to finish up with UPitt's essays.
