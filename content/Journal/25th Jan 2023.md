The day started out fine. The standard: worked out, dropped vivi at the bus stop and ate breakfast.

The fog's back now. It's like mid-winter again. It was clear in the morning, just a little bit of it when I went to the gym. While coming back, I could tell it had increased. At the bus stop, I could literally see it moving in. It was like Lovedale.

Speaking of Lovedale, I'm meeting Yuvaraj and Uday next Friday. They're both in Delhi. Surprisingly Yuvaraj switched to law. That's just a mad shift. Pretty brave of him honestly. Requires that internal trust in yourself. Do I feel that way about CS? I think I do.

Design is hard. Not **hard**. But it's perfectionism showing up again. Especially _unique_ web design. Almost all websites look the same these days, and for good reasonâ€“they're simple to navigate and laid out in a familiar chronological order. But I want mine to be different. I don't know how.
