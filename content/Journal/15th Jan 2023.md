Started today well. Got up early, and easily. Had the option to not run, but chose the hard route.

Today's Pongal. I usually don't care for these festivals, but it's not the same this time cuz I wrote about Pongal in one of my essays. That mini-essay is one of my favorites. I realized that while I've written a decent amount of essays on my blog for 1 year, none of them are that great. I think it's because I spend like two days on each one. Meh topic choice, with poor writing, almost no editing, and literally no external review.
