It's been a while since I last wrote anything.

The term's pretty much over! It's been one hell of a term. So many things happening all at once. I'm gonna sit down and write a proper reflection of this term. Soon after the exams, before I forgot stuff.

I don't know why I randomly got the urge to write today. Maybe it's cuz my calculus final went well, or cuz I can _feel_ the term ending and writing always feels kinda nostalgic or because physics stress hasn't shown up yet. I'm feeling very procrastinate-y today. I'm gonna start studying physics soon. Gonna go for dinner and start physics.

Today was nice. Not particularly amazing in any way (except that calc went really well). But a nice day for an average uni student day. I will fight average-ness!

Cuz of finals this past week, it's been a while since I typed _anything_ long form. After typing linear algebra this entire term, it's weird not doing it at all.

Time flew so fast. So fucking fast. I was in India this August. Feels like I've been in Waterloo forever, yet everything feels so new. Human perception is so weird. I've done so much and so little this past term. Time goes fucking fast. Need to grab hold of it and slow it down next termâ€“savor the moments. We gon' accelerate so fucking much!
