In each stage of your life, you have a different relationship with normalcy. Before school, everyone you know is grown up and stressed, you're pretty different; when you're just starting school, you don't even know you're different, you feel bad that the other kid is good at football _and_ basketball; as a teen, you wanna be the cool guy, that suave, sweet talker who doesn't care about grades, it's painfully awkward when you try but still; late teen, college season makes you reflect and now you _want_ to be different.

Me using Vim, Firefox, fancy keebs, caring about privacy might just be me running away from normalcy. I hope it's not. It's probably not cuz I did try using VSCode, recently, I have some genuine problems with it. But yeah, there's a part of me that tries doing things differently, for the sake of being different.
