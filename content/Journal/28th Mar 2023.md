Waterloo coming out was a relief. Finally an A-tier college. But I'm still waiting for their CS results which probably come in May.

I've been coding, like with full focus, for about 2 years now and most of what I've built essentially boils down to: setup react boilerplate, add some styles and then use the web page as a bridge to an external api. The end result, for the average user, is really cool but I sometimes if that's even programming? I want to dive deeper into _something_. That something's probably gonna be smart contracts; Solidity, Yul, Huff and so on..

I've to write a bunch of scholarship essays for PennState. I'm probably not gonna go there, since I got into Waterloo, but I guess it's still nice to have a backup.
