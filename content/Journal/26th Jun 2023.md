As I'm checking off more and more pre-college to-do items the one thing that keeps coming back is meeting friends. I'm almost done with the documentation (submitting passport for stamping today), I pretty much done with clothes shopping. So I dm-ed Nishant and told him I'd be coming to Mumbai next month to chill with them. This is significant because it'll keep me accountable, silently.

I still can't believe I'm going to college. In some ways I still feel like the ninth grader who messed up his own values to be _cool_; in some ways I've grown beyond that, much beyond all that, so much so that I barely talk to humans anymore...

And that fact that it's Waterloo is crazier still. One of the best tech schools in the world. When you're ambitious and a dreamer you can visualize yourself there, I visualized myself is MIT, Caltech, Berkeley, Texas, UIUC. And over the last year or so, many of those visualizations have come crashing down. And now, out of nowhere I have been gifted something that's just as good. Now it's my job to make the best of it. To make the best of the professors and their expertise, to make the best of the resources and opportunities of the uni and to make the best of my early twenties!

Feels like new day now.
