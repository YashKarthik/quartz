I've been meaning to write more; now I am.

I scruffed gym, not to write, to sleep, but sleep's not coming.

I wrote a rough outline of the story. It's kinda standard tbh, but that's ok.

I mostly work on my desk. For all serious work–full on coding, writing, submitting college apps–that's the place. But because it's supposed to be a full-on work desk it's hard to just pick myself up from the bed and sit on it to work. So now-a-days a lot of work I do happens on the couch, the dining table, even my bed. None of them are as comfortable as my main table, but it's just so easy to get started in these places. I know it's fucking stupid, I'm literally just sitting on a table. But there's some extra mental effort involved in getting on that desk. I might be cuz of setting up the keeb and mouse and the different wires. So, getting a wireless corne would be super useful, I could carry my laptop to different places and still use a real keyboard.
