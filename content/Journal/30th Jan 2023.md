Today, my shoulders and chest are dead.

Now that I have so much more free time, I'm not sure what to spend all that time on. I have my coding checklist; so I guess I'm gonna go through it.

Looking through my old blog posts, I realized that a lot of them were summaries / derived from a podcast or another blog. And most of the time they felt pretty rushed. I think I know whyâ€“I was just trying to get it out of the door and published so that I could feel good about posting another one. But I never took care to improve upon them. So most of the stuff on my blog is pretty trash writing. I realized that I can write pretty well during this college application season and now I need to bring that writing skill to my blog. One thing that may have affected my writing quality for college essays was the fact that my life literally depended on it. My blog... I mean who even reads it. Another thing is that college essays always had a topic. I had to match the prompt with an experience I've had. But for blogs, I just have to find some topic and turn it into text. Constraints give freedom; I had no constrains, so no freedom.

In summary,
- Give yourself more time to write it.
- Edit them.
- Figure out an idea strategy.
