I like the consistency of my journalling time. Almost everyday, at this time, I'm on the couch, writing. And I always seem to know my first sentence, and after that I spend a couple of minutes trying to figure out what to write.

The weather in Gurgaon is really wack. It was raining the night before, almost sunny yesterday, pretty clear last evening, and now it's middle of the winterâ€“the fog is really thick, but it's not that cold, just foggy.
