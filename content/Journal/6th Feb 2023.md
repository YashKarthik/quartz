## 07:50
I usually hit snooze thrice before waking up. Samsung has this press-and-hold button for dismissing the alarm, and a tiny 5 min snooze button in the corner. Today morning, I got confused between the two and hit cancel even though I wasn't fully awake. So instead of waking up at 6, I woke up at 6.30. So I thought I'd skip gym cuz it was too late, but my dad ....I went to gym. But since I started at the gym at 6.50–almost my closing time–I switched a full workout with a run. I should probably run more; it's refreshing. Maybe not everyday, but alternating between a run-day and a workout day would be nice.

I still haven't received any news from Spearbit. I'm gonna write to them.

I also need to fill out the MIT fun form by tomorrow.
