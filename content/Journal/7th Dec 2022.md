I took the SAT a couple days ago. I think it went well.

The past couple of days I've literally been just writing. Every morning I get up and do some basic stuff and then I sit and write. It's kinda crazy my entire day is spent writing. Yet, I don't find time to write here. Lol. The duality.

After this whole essay stuff is over I'm gonna live-streaming myself coding stuff. It'll be fun to try out something different. Way different than anything I would do. I'm gonna livestream myself doing the eth-speedrun. It's gonna be fun.

This past couple of weeks I haven't written any blogs and haven't read much. My rss reader inbox has gotten full. Need to start reading again. There's so many distracting things to do. Quick dopamine really is the modern enemy.
