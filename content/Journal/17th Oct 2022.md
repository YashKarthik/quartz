Today started as usual. Work out, drop vivi, breakfast. I was supposed to have SAT class but he didn't show up. I usually would've wasted this time but I worked some math problems. That felt good. I then filled in the basic details in my MIT and UC applications. Since I had some time, but not enough energy to write an essay, I did some coding. I figured out how to generate an image of a user's circle. Now the elephant of the day is to write my essay.

Writing is hard. It's fun but hard. It's thinking about what to write. Then manipulating words to say that in a beautiful way.

Writing is like working out. Feels super hard before you start it. But awesome when you're doing it.

Logging off for the day (i think). Today was good.

I showed my essay to my dad. He liked it. It's a different level of validation when my dad approves of it. It feels nice.
