I'm officially a member of WARG now! Pretty cool. Low level stuff is hard, weird, scary but exciting. I can't believe there's only one week left for uni.

I'm gonna get my Macbook checked today. Something about Battery service recommendedâ€“hopefully I don't have to replace the battery. The capacity is reasonable now so idk what it's about.

I also started doing some math. Hopefully I can cover some decent ground before going to uni.
