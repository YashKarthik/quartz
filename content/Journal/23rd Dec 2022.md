I'm gonna submit MIT, Stanford, Cornell and UIUC today. All giants, if I get in any of them I'm gonna go blindly.

I have this weird habit with blogs where I don't read them, not even a bit unless I have like an hour to read and take notes from them. This is like the opposite of what Naval said. He said treat books like blogs and drop them when they get boring. I'm literally doing the opposite. I have like 200 posts in my RSS inbox. I need to be okay with reading just half of it. Absorbing half the knowledge is better than none.

I really, _really_ wish I get into MIT. I have good test scores, good coursework considering I'm in India and decent ECs. I think I have pretty good essays, so that might be the key. I'm probably one of the few Indians submitting a Maker Portfolio. Hopefully it all works out.
