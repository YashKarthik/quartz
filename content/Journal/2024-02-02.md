This week went by so fast. Usually good things go fast. So the week going by fast means it was good? Right. I think it's actually easy things go fast. So the speed of things actually represents the ease of the activity and not the enjoyment. Maybe. Actually no. Easy things do go by fast but so do hard, but fun things. But yeah the week went by so fast.

Mindset is so important. I approached 1A with care. Too careful about things. I was also kinda semi-aimless in 1A. 1B has been a lot more focussed and _fuck it_ vibes.

I think I'm pretty much over meem now. I have been for weeks now. The only to get over her even more is for me to start meeting more _girls_. Just in general meeting more people and actually talking to them. Not just hey. Even hey would be a nice upgrade though.
