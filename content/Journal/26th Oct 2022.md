All productivity advice contains "advice" on productivity and meta tips that improve work-life balance. I realized, I have no work-life balance. I usually just code till it's time for dinner. Or on my less productive days, I usually just scroll till it's time for dinner. That's no balance. Yeah, balance doesn't mean 50/50. It's kinda like a line following bot - correcting, overcorrecting, under-correcting... It's not balance, but a balancing act. But the extent of over/under determines how close you are to work-life balance. I'm really far. My under/over-corrections are not slight wobbles, they are full-on swings.

Yesterday's visit to the Central Vista was nice.
