I've never really seen people in front of me have mood swings; but I don't know how, I missed my dad. He has daily mood swings. It's really bad with college and stuff. One moment he's saying, alright lets dump everything else and focus on Waterloo, next moment he's saying let's go to PennState instead.

I've been way less productive these days. I've got a lot and a nothing on my plate at once. There's a lot of stuff I _want_ to do–I want to do more smart contract coding, I've got this project going on with Dylan, I want to make cool AI apps–but there's also a lot of stuff I _don't_ want to do–all the junk doc submission for my license, researching the visa process and shit like that.
