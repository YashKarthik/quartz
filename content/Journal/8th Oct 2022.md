My body ached from yesterday's basketball sesh. It was fun thought. I didn't wanna go to the gym today. I went anyway when I heard the rumblings in the other room. I fear my father.

Gym was fine. Only the short trainer was there. I did my own thing for my chest. It wasn't great though. You feel different when you've had a truly satisfying session.

I came home and lmao slept in my bed. I was really sleepy. Then the whole Saturday stuff. Clean the room and shit. It wasn't as bad as some of the other weekends though.

Then i sat down in front of my laptop. Did some writing for Protocol DAO. I'm almost doen with the Farcaster write-up.

I really hate it when my mom comes to me in the middle of my work sessions and asks me to go to the grocery store or something. I'm literally in the middle of something. And they even deliver to your home. She could've just ordered it. Also she was trying to keep it hush cuz my dad would go nuke on her if he realized she hadn't made food and they were leaving in an hour. Lol. I went and got a block of paneer. Turns out the guy had already delivered one.

Now I've gotta call my teachers and stuff.

Today was a fairly productive day. I'm almost done with the farcaster post. Did a bit of coding, and ethereum related work. Spoke to teachers and Aswin for LOR. Watched tv.
