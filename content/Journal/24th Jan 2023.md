Starting today's writing at the same time as yesterday. Lol.

My mom, for some reason, loves watching news. Morning, news; afternoon, news, but I convince her put something worth watching; evening, news. And it's that super inflammatory news on high volume. That's why today I'm writing in the bed room instead of the sofa, wit on high volume. That's why today I'm writing in the bed room instead of the sofa.

It looks like it's gonna rain. It's been a while.

The biggest mistake I make each day is trying to do tasks when I'm journalling. Separation of concerns is important here. Journalling is a time for my brain to unload a night of thinking into text. During this unload a bunch of todos also fall out of my brain, and instead of writing them down, I try to do them. A good thing is that the task is done and can be forgotten, but the flowing river of god knows what is now clogged.

I don't know why obviously bad things are so hard to resist. That TED video on procrastination as a flight or fight response is so good. It makes total sense.
