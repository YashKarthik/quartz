My reading might already be getting better. I realized this problem has two parts: one is the difficulty in reading long-winding sentence strung together, composed of multiple sentences. These are less common in blogs and stuff, so that's why I'm finding it difficult. So to understand these sentences, I read slowly. This is the other half of the problem. An image gets painted by sentences not by words. And reading slow, makes the imagination part harder.

But I think I'm improving. Maybe because the story is getting interesting or maybe because I'm getting the hang of Gibson's writing.

I wanna build a split keyboard this year. Probably gonna go with a Corne.

I went on instagram and saw a bunch of posts. My Lawrence gang is having fun, together. It's weird seeing your friends without you. I was a different person back then. Can't tell if my change is for the better. I'm having way more fun with _work_ now. But hardly any fun with friends. I had a lot more fun with friends back then. I remember having fun, but now I'm not sure I'd consider some of it fun. Also, this is like that moment in the Wimpy Kid books where Greg gets jealous cuz his classmates have a life. I do need to make friends and have fun.
