Had a nice run today. Gonna start lifting weights n stuff from Monday I guess. Today evening's Waterloo Engineering Ready Day, let's see how that goes. Hopefully I'll make some friends.

I need a haircut. For some reason, Arya wants me to keep my long hair. She says it hides my ugly face, I'm sure that's true but long hair is just too much effort man. I'll go for some semi long hair style that doesn't take too much effort to maintain. I should do some research.

It's already mid-July. College starts in a month-and-a-half. How fast man. I need to learn C and revise my math. I also need to count everything and ensure that I've actually got enough clothes. I should go buy from pantaloons and stuff man, that shits much cheaper. I hope I get a decent roommate man. We don't even get to know who it is until we land there.
