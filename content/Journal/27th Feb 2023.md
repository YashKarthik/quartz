# Journal
## 07:53
It's been a while since I journaled, or really wrote anything. I realized writing right after dropping Vivi off isn't sustainable, and tried to push it to afternoon. But these days, I go for my driving practice before lunch so coding time got shortened, so I pushed coding after lunch.

Last week, I got my PennState and ASU acceptance. It was relieving, especially PennState, cuz now I know I'm gonna go _somewhere_. I also got rejected by UT Austin, haven't told my parents yet. I guess, I'll tell them after I get an acceptance by a non-safety.

I haven't read that many blogs eitherâ€“afternoon was supposed to be my reading and writing time. I've read Neuromancer quite a bit though, I'm almost done. It's pretty cool.
