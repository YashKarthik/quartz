Whenever there's shit that I don't wanna do, I waste a lot of time. One way would be to never agree to do things you don't wanna do. That probably wouldn't work in a human world, we all have to do shit we don't wanna do sometimes. This is probably got something to do with my shit discipline. This happens mostly on things that are done alone and require brain. Procrastination is my flight response. I watched a video on ted that talked about how are brain feels _safe_ by not doing the hard task. How on earth did all these shitty hormonal reactions survive through millions of years of evolution.

I wanted to read the backlog of blog posts my Nat Eliason, Paul Graham, Perell etc. But since I was tired from doing boring stuff from the morning, I opened YouTube. That's the worst app on my phone. I'm locking it up. I don't even need it. Just did. Hopefully it sticks. I hate short-form video. It's just so addicting. I don't even know why. All those precious minutes, hours, slipping through my fingers as I scroll even though I don't wanna scroll.

I just went through my backlog of Perell's newsletter. Cleared it.

Just read Maggie Appleton's [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#the-six-patterns-of-gardening). I'm redesigning my entire blog.
