I've mostly figured out what clothes and stuff to buy.

Everyday in home is hell. I'm too lazy to code or write. To distracted to read until the end of the day when everyone is sleeping. So most of the time I'm scrolling on instagram or open my laptop to watch youtube shorts. WTF. Such a giant waste of my time. I don't exactly wanna be productive; I just wanna have fun with my time here and instead I waste it on the internetâ€“the shit parts that too. And also my mom's always calling me for bullshit chores. Way too often.
