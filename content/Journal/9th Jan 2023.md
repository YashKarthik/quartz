Trying to start this week right. Went for an early morning run. Good breakfast. Then wasted some time. And now starting the day. Today's gonna be mostly writing day. I need to finish the ETHIndia Fellowship application and finalize if I'm gonna apply to UMD, UW-Madison. I don't want to. I probably will not go if I do get in, but... we'll see.

I think my reading skills are back. I think it was mostly me getting used to Gibson's writing style. It'.s starting to get exciting.
