Went swimming today. Was great. Been a while since I swam in the morning; first time with googles. So the bright pool was nice change. I did my resume yesterday. The format and basic content is good I guess, but I think I need to rewrite the bullet points. Latex is powerful, I hope I don't get too distracted playing with it.

My phone is also mostly setup. Just need to install a map and music.
