Yesterday's interview went well. I could've been slower and calmer, but it's alright. The interview was the main event of the day, but after that I checked my mail to confirm the interview, and UT Austin has released my decision. I haven't viewed it or even told my parents that UT has released them. I dunno, I just have this weird feeling that I won't get in. It's totally fine if I don't get in, but it's the first uni to have released, so that's why it would be great if I do get in.

I'm not sure how effective my workout's been. And how useless my diet's been.

It's Friday, I wanna build some cool project. Not sure what to build though. I might build the Twitter-nft-viewer browser extension thingy. Would give me a chance to experiment with React and stuff for browser extensions. I could also learn Go and build another Farcaster indexer. I could complete speedrun ethereum. I have to finish my website too. I need to do something with solidity, I can't make progress on Damn Vulnerable Defi without understanding Gnosis smart contracts.
