I finished ethernaut day-before-yesterday and since then the only "project" for me has been my website redesign. I'm gonna try to finish it by today. Astro is really great for building these type of websites. You get the tooling and packages of the TS ecosystem, a better way to think about logic thanks to React and JSX, and a static html page as the output. I also applied to SpearbitDAO yesterday, as an apprentice. Haven't received any mail from them yet, probably cuz it's the weekend. If I get into this, it would be huge. Huge for learning, I get to work under leading security experts, and huge for college. I'll put that in my MIT fun form.

I haven't really followed my schedule. It had a good balance of reading, writing and coding. The only thing I've done in that list is coding. Probably because, I can _feel_ the effects of coding more, immediately. Like I've been doing solidity for the past month, and  I'm not scared of it anymore. But it's harder to measure an improvement in reading / writing. Also, I haven't done much to my diet. It's mostly the same junk.
