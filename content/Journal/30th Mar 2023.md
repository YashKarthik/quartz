I can't wait to be done with driving schoolâ€“it's such a time sink. More than an hour wasted. I'm decent at driving now. And it's at such a  bad time. Right in the start of the day: 11. I can't do anything before it, and after coming back it's just an hour until lunch so can't really do much. [[References/Meetings Affect Programmers more; Makers vs Manager Schedule]]. I haven't written much code the past few days either. I wanna finish building that smart contract chat app. It's pretty stupid, storying chats on a blockchain, but still fun to build and see.

Imma go for the driving class now - 10:24
