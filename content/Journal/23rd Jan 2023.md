Today's workout was brutal–good. At the end, when I had to do another 3 sets of pushups, my arms literally gave up. Feels good. I managed to get up at 6 and go to the gym. That was good. I started with snoozing, as usual, but then suddenly I remembered I've to drop Vivi off to the bus stop and that kinda triggered me to wake up. I think I need a shock like that to wake up early. I also realized that my perfect routine forgot about dropping him off. 7-8 is my morning pages time, but I literally started 10 minutes before the end of it. I think I can take the time from my bath+breakfast time–it's way to long anyway.

The weather seems to be back on it's track to improve.

ETHIndia's fellowship cohort was to be announced last night. Didn't check yet. Not sure if they have announced it, maybe they've delayed it.

Had a good writing session. Went back and improved some old notes, thought about them and stuff. Nice. I like this schedule.
