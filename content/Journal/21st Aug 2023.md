There's just ten days left. During exams, I would get this _kick_ like three days before the exam. Before covid, I'd have finished studying by this kick time and would reduce studying post-kick. During 11th, 12th I _started_ studying with this kick. I expect I'll be feeling a kick by the end of this week. But I'm not entirely sure what the kick is for. I think it would be for dropping everything and relaxing, spending time with family.

I'm gonna chill on the coding from now. After this, my entire life is coding and related stuff. I should revise some math.

I hope Obsidian releases the properties feature too all users soon.

I read Mistborn today morning after sooo long. It was a nice read. I don't know why it doesn't have the grip to make me keep reading like harry potter did. I guess it's partly because of the writing style and also cuz there's so many things to keep track of.

I should also give my laptop and keyboard a nice clean up before going to uni.
