The day started out pseudo-fine. I ran, and ran wellâ€“so it's started out fine. I couldn't pull myself out of bed at 6 though. So my entire schedule in an hour late. It'll be good to test out my schedules flexibility.

I said I'd write about 500 words in my journal each day. Not sure what to write about.

Today morning was surprisingly cold; for the past couple of days, there's been almost no fog and reasonable temps. But today, the fog was there. When I got up, it wasn't that much; it's gotten worse now.

A bunch of universities sent some updates today. Who tf call their February Updates Form, the "FUN Form". MIT. After all this cute language-ing they reject everyone. If by any fluke of the universe I get in; man that'll be awesome.
