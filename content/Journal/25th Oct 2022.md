Went for a run. Winter has really started here. There's a secret room in the gym. From the outside it's hidden like a janitor's closet, but I suspect there's some other stuff inside. Cuz my trainer today basically scruffed gym today. lol.

My day usually involves doing "work" before and after lunch. But for the past couple of weeks I've noticed I'm usually way too tired to do anything meaningful after lunch. If I'm getting tired so easily, how am I gonna survive in uni?
