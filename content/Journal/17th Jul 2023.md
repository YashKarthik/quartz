I haven't had an interesting project to work on for quite a while. That's one of the reasons I haven't written much code over the past month. Suddenly a few days ago I felt like doing Advent of Code, in Go! It's been fun I've done like 3 problems so far and it's pretty good. Go is a good balance between a function for everything like python, versus C which is a different level all together.
