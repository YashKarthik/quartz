The opportunity cost of not being with ambitious people is too high to ignore. It's no longer a question; I must meet and build relationships with more ambitious people. I have been meeting a lot of smart folks, but I don't know how to build longer term relationships with them. I should've applied to software eng. People are so much more ambitious there. Either way I'm in fucking university not school, I should meet more people. The only ways I meet people are through Socraticaâ€“I should meet more people. I should take connect deeper with the people in my class. I only know the Indians, I should talk to more people.

I'm stressed. I'm not doing enough.

This week was weirdly stressful. We had more labs the week before, but somehow this week I was under more stress. It was probably cuz of the in person interview and the walking group thing. And the leftover disappointment from last weekend cuz of not doing enough. This weekend though. I am gonna build so much. I might actually spend the entire Saturday in the FPGA lab building that LCD thing. I wanna build more hardware too.
