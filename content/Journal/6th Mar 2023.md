Life is going fine. I got rejected from UIUC, UT Austin. I'm over it now. I don't go to the gym these days, I go for a walk and listen to Naval's pod while walking. I shouldn't do that, I know. Programming is going well, I'm building some cool stuff. I may have over-committed. Now that college decisions are rolling in, I need to start hunting for scholarships, housing and research other junk. It's such a drag.

There's just so many things on my mind, and plate that I've not written or read much the past... month? I managed to finish Neuromancer, I need to read it again though.
