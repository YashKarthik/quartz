Finally. After 6000 international matches, Messi has finally won the World Cup. It was a **mad** match. Up, down, up, down and then finally to penalties.

Two wins this week: SAT, Messi. Awesome!

I've got to finish my essay for MIT and Stanford. I really like writing the _montage_ type essays. The ones that kinda take you through your room, describing the weird fixtures and stuff. But that doesn't really fit any of the essays I'm writing about. Maybe I could make the first paragraph of the [[College Essays/Stanford/What is meaningful to you and why]] essay into a montage kinda thing.

I also feel like I would like writing fiction. I should try it out sometimes on my blog.

This past 6 months, AI has really got onto the hype-cycle. The advances have been breakneck fast. Some of these, especially LLMs, kinda scare me too. I mean I'm all for automating things using robots and AI, but these LLMs are coming at programmers! Now I kinda understand why many don't like automation. But again, the coding LLMs won't replace programmers, they'll just change the way we code. Coding will now involve more prompt engineering I guess.
