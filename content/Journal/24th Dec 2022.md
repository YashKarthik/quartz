There was just this weird sense of time yesterday. I submitted UIUC and Stanford. MIT and Cornell after they come back from NDA. I didn't have the conviction to submit MIT yesterday. If I had submitted, I could've chilled a bit more this weekend. It's not like I have anything to do in the application. It's done, but I just didn't wanna submit it in a hurry.

I'm not sure what I'll do this weekend. I have to record my maker portfolio and come up with a couple of words to describe Cornell. Other than that I'm basically free.
