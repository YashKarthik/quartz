It's really wild, that without any prodding, I don't get up. I don't have my father or any project to prod me awake. Today's Christmas! It's not like I actually celebrate it, but it's nice. Outside, instead of snowing, there's just a blanket of fog. Inside, it's not exactly warm–we don't use central heaters–but my feet are getting roasted.

Today I have to finish my maker portfolio's video. I think I have a decent script, it should be easy. Some maker portfolios are just mad. One guy literally made the angular control thingy for his rocket! In high school! I mean that's just next level. Hopefully they judge against your background, in that case, I should be relatively okay.

I'm also gonna go for some hackathons. First on is in the last week of Jan. It's virtual. I wanna go for some physical hackathons too. ETHGlobal Tokyo is happening in April. But Idk if I'll be able to go. I keep forgetting Epoch. That's happening this weekend. I don't have a good jacket to take. I'll freeze.

I also need to write the technical writeup for my maker portfolio. I don't even know where to start this one. I think I'm gonna go with the 1. challenge. and 2. solution. 3. issues with solution finally 4. solutions to issues with solution. And at the start and end provide a nice abstract.
