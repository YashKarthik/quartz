Last night's meetup was decent. Caught up with others. After meetups like these, I have a sudden interest in connecting/staying in touch with other Lawrence folks. Maybe it's cause I might not find such close friends ever again. All these guys I've visited, they don't really have _close friends_ in college. Maybe it's Indian college culture, cuz I don't wanna stop making more good friends.

I ordered my backpack finally. It'll be here by the end of the week.

I'm gonna start the WARG onboarding today. I need to do that math course.

I know I shouldn't really compare, but compared to the rest of my batch I think I've got into a pretty good college. Waterloo's fucking top 20 in the world man. That's like a whole another league from IITs even. It's good, it's good. After my wild ride in 11th, 12th, I'm **very** happy with what I've got.

Had a minor scare. For some reason my nextcloud just wasn't loading. Rebooted the linode and now everything's back online.
