During my day-schooling days. The single worst thing that could happen was forgetting something at home. Forgetting a notebook–an honest mistake with no real consequences–to forgetting to wear different clothes–no _real_ consequences, but school was real enough for me back then. I would literally prefer skipping school. My bro's okay though. He doesn't care for this stuff. It's useful to not care about this shit.

The main task for today finishing the forms in MIT Maker Portfolio. I thought they'd be some simple questions, but they're asking some deep shit like why do you make.

A bunch of kids at Hack Club got in. I'm calling them kids like they're younger than me. When I see their profiles, some of them are true geniuses, some normal and kinda wonder why they got in. But still, it's mad that I'm aware of someone getting it. Like it somehow makes the impossibility of getting into MIT a bit more real, while also pushing it further once I look into their work. I don't have that quality of work, nowhere near, I _hope_ my essays make up for that. If I just get into MIT. I mean.... it'll be killer. Or any of my reaches, but yeah, MIT is preferable.

I think I'd be reasonably _successful_ without getting into MIT, but getting in there just multiplies my chances by a 100 and multiplies the *level* success by another 100. It's kinda weird. The _education_ colleges are supposedly known for, is available for free on the web. It's the got something to do with the people there.

It's been a while since I last journaled properly. It's nice to know I still have thoughts inside me.

I have this weird reaction to, I guess, mainstream media when they talk about topics I know about. Mostly surrounding tech, and the people in tech. I kinda just wanna change the channel or mute it. It's partly because I know they don't usually cover the full story. And partly because I'm afraid of being called wrong, especially by my own family. It's weird, smart people aren't afraid of being called out. I'm sure they are, they just train themselves to be okay with it. Another trained skill, I guess.

Two years ago, when we were planning to apply to US colleges and all that, I wouldn't have thought I'd be doing the essays with my dad. They felt just, too personal to share with my family (weird that I'm ok sharing stuff with strangers than with my family, it's the fear of the consequences or something, I guess). Now, weirdly, all of my essay are reviewed by my dad. It's brought us together, I think. Movies make it so normal/easy to think of your relationships this verbosely.

My browser extension–Skimmr–is done. At decent-enough MVP is done. I submitted it for webstore review. This whole shift to manifest-v3 has **broken** all compatibility between Chrome and all other browsers. So I basically have to write the extension twice. Once using manifest-v2 and the `browser` APIs, then again using manifest-v3 and the `chrome` APIs. Fucking google.

There's just something weirdly _nice_ about winter. Sitting warm inside the house typing away at your keyboard, or reading some awesome book. That image, though idillic, is nice and kinda the main thing that draws me to winter. This morning it's literally that. Outside the winter, there is a wall of white fog–smog since Delhi. And I'm inside typing away.

In the past year my dad has gone to the hospital so many times. It started with the kidney stones, then a cancer scare and then his semi-regular exhaustion-related. It's scary when it hits you. It's that probability bias in humans.
