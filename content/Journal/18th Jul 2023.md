Everything's fine. Weirdly I'm motivated again. I'm changing my sleep schedule, gonna start waking up early and stuff. This is good because I hope to maintain it in university. Cause project ideas are not exactly flowing, I'm doing Advent of Code in Go. I should probably be doing it in C, no reason to do in Go. But it's pretty nice. I'll learn C after I do some Go.

I'm still sleepy now, so there's that. Hopefully moving my schedule will at least get rid of this.
