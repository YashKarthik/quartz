It's been a while since I last opened obsidian. I don't open this and the rss reader in times of high real life stress. I don't know if that's good or not. Instead of opening these apps, I end up on scroll hell. Been writing essays, constantly, for the past couple of weeks. It's fun, but every once in a while becomes super stressful. I hope I get into a good uni.
