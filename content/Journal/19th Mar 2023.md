# Journal
## 07:27
It has been so long since I've journaled, or even written anything. After the college application madness I used to write every morning. But quickly that devolved into early morning social media. So now I usually just get ready quickly.

I **finally** started reading Harry Potter. I've been meaning to read it for a long time now and there was always something in the wayâ€“Jee, boards, college. Now finally I can prioritize some reading. My last book before this was Neuromancer and HP is way easier to read. I though I'd forgotten to read.
