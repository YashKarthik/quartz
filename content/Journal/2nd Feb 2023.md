I skipped gym today. There are some days you just can't push yourself.

Wtf should I write in my journal.

I was just going through my coding checklist for this year. I think I can tick Solidity off in a couple more days. I'm not _scared_ of it anymore. It doesn't make as much sense as TS does, but it makes way more sense than it did a month ago. The thing is, that to master solidity, you also need to understand the underlying machine–the EVM. So after I'm done with Ethernaut, I'm gonna do another CTF, probably Damn Vulnerable Defi, and also read the ethereum book, yellow paper. I think I should also start preparing my resume and apply to some jobs.

Today we're going the bank to clear up my account issues. TradFi–such a painfully inefficient institution.

Coding early in the morning is weird. It's not at all like writing in the morning. Early morning writing clears up my brain and I'm energized to do take on shit. Early morning coding kinda drains my brain, but I'm at peak productivity so shit gets done.
