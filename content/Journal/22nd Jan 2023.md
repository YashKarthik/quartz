Sunday. A day of laziness. A day to chill out and catch up with your friends and family. For me it's a day to catch up on work. Not work work. But fun work.

I think I've kinda figured out my daily schedule. It's not too custom, but gives me enough time to read, write and code. Currently, without a schedule, I'm able to do like 2/3 of them; sometimes worse. But now, I think I'll be able to hit all three.
