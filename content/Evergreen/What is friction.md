- Friction is a force that opposes contact motion.
- It is caused due to some sort of bonding between the object being pushed and the surface it is sitting on.

- Before our object starts moving, our push is opposed by static friction.
- Once we overcome the static friction and our object starts rolling, our object still faces _some_, though less, friction called kinetic/dynamic friction.
