# Static Friction
- The actual magnitude of static friction ranges between 0 and a max value.
- From intuition we know that the harder we press our object against a surface, the greater friction we feel when trying to push it.
	- I.e. static friction (max value) depends on the force attaching it to the surface.
	- Since this would be weird to calculate, we can use the normal force.
	- Normal force = force holding object to surface; cuz they have to be the same unless the table is collapsing.
$$
\begin{align}
f_{s,max} \propto F_N\\
f_{s,max} = \mu_sF_N\\
\end{align}
$$
Where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction (just a proportionality constant).
# Kinetic Friction
Similarly:
$$
f_k = \mu_kF_N\\
$$
Where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

- But static friction does not have a range, $f_k$ is the magnitude whenever the object is moving.
