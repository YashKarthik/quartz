- If we have two span sets where one of the spanning sets has an extra element.
- That extra element can be represented as a linear combination of the other elements.
- So we have a theorem that says that IFF we have two Span sets that are equal then one of the elements in the spanning sets can be represented as a linear combination of the other elements. (theorem in `reference`).
