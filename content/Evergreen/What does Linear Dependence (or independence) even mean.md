- In spanning sets, we could exclude certain elements and the span of the set would still be the same.
- Here, the element that was excluded could be expressed as a linear combination of the other elements.
- This means that the element is linearly dependent on the other elements.

$$
\begin{align}
A = B + C\\
\implies B = A - C
\end{align}
$$
- This means that we could exclude some other element by expressing it as a linear combination of the remaining elements.
- So linear dependence basically ties in all the elements of the set.
