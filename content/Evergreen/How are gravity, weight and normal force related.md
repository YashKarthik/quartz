# Gravitation
- It's the force that acts on a body, attracting it towards a second body. Usually the second body is the Earth.
$$
F_g = mg
$$
# Weight
- Weight is the magnitude of net force one would need to apply to prevent a body from freely falling.
- This is the same as the gravitational force, but in the opposite direction.
$$ W = -mg $$
# Normal Force
- When a body is pushed against another body, each of the bodies exert some force on the other body.
- This force is called the normal force and it is perpendicular to the surface of the exerting body.

**Example:**
- When an box is kept on a table the body is pulled toward the earth with $mg$.
- The amount of force required to hold this up would be $mg$.
- The table holds up the body without breaking => the normal force exerted by the table on the box is $mg$.
