$$
\text{Ker}(L) = \{\vec x \in \mathbb R^n\ |\ L(\vec x) = \vec 0 \}
$$
The set of all vectors that land on the origin after going through the transformation.

- $\text{Ker}(L)$ is a subset of Rn cuz these xs belong in Rn.

Translating this to matrix-ish notation:
- We can see that the kernel is same as the nullspace of $[L]$.
	- Null space refers to the set of vectors that land on origin after the matrix transformation.
- Hence, the kernel is also a subspace.
