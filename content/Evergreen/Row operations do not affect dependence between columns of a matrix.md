- The theorem in `reference` basically says that a/any linear combination of the columns of $A$ can be equal to 0 iff a/any linear combinations of the columns of $B$ can be equal to 0.
- Where $B$ is obtained through row operations on $A$.
- Since equating linear combinations of vectors to zero helps us test linear dependence of the set [1], the theorem says that if the columns were dependent _before_ the row operations, the columns will _still_ be dependent.
