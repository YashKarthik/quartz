# Diagonalization Theorem
$A$ is diagonalizable iff eigenvectors of $A$ are a basis for $R^n$.

Given that A is diagonalizable, the jth column of P will contain the jth vector from the basis of eigenvectors, and the jth column of the diagonal matrix D will contain the corresponding eigenvalue in the (j, j)âˆ’entry

See examples in lecture notes.

# Corollary 1
$A$ is diagonalizable iff $a_\lambda = g_\lambda$ for every $\lambda$ of $A$.

# Corollary 2
If $A_{n\times n}$ has $n$ eigenvalues, then $A$ is diagonalizable.
