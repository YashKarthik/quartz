> If an object A exerts a force on object B, then object B must exert a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on object A.

$$
F_{AB} = - F_{BA}
$$
($F_{AB}:$ force on A cuz of B)
- Such pairs are called third law force pairs.
	- Their are other force pairs with equal magnitude and opposite direction.
	- Like Normal force from a table and the gravity of earth. This is _not_ a third law force pair. N is between table and ball, and gravity is between earth and ball.
	- But a ball kept on the earth directly will experience the third law pair force. Normal from earth and gravity from earth.
