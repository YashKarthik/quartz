- Doing the subspace test on eigenspaces is trivial, like for other subspaces.

- Need to understand why the eigenspace might be a subspace for $\mathbb R^n$ or $\mathbb C^n$.

# Bases of Eigenspaces
- Having a bases for our eigenspaces will enable us to _reach_ every vector in the respective eigenspace as a linear combination of those bases.
