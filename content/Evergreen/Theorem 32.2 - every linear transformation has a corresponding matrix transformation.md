- The columns of a matrix represent what they do to the $n$-th basis vector.
- Creating a matrix like so: $[L(\vec e_1) \ \  L(\vec e_2)... \ \ L(\vec e_n)]$ let's us represent what $L$ does to each of the basis vectors, hence capturing what each of the column would to do the $n$-th basis vector.

- $[L]$ is the standard matrix of transformation $L$.
- So to find the standard matrix, we evaluate $L$ with $\vec e_i$ for each $n$.
