- They don't prove it but it's true.
- It makes sense cuz $\lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{bmatrix}$, so det(A - $\lambda I$) should have some sort of multiplication between those $n$ number of $\lambda$ terms.

Extending this,
- Since $C_A(\lambda)$ has $n$ roots, there can be _maximum_ $n$ distinct eigenvalues.
- This connects to [[Evergreen/Algebraic Multiplicity of an Eigenvalue|Algebraic Multiplicity of an Eigenvalue]].
