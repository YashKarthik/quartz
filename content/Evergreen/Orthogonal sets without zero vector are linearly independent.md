Thinking visually; if two vectors are orthogonal, there's no way to express either vector as a linear combination of the other. They are just on two different axes.

**Converse:** if the number of vectors in this set is greater than $n$, then the set is linearly dependent. You don't need more than $n$ vectors to span $R^n$.
