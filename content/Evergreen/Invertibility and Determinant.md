If det != 0 <=> matrix inverse exists.

- Determinants measure factor of area change.
- Matrix inverses are basically like _playing_ the matrix operation in reverse.

- If the determinant of a certain matrix is zero, then that operation squishes the grid into a lower dimension (so into a line, into a plane, into a point etc).
- If the entire universe is squished into a single point, then the reverse will have to be a one-to-many operation as we would be re-expanding the entire universe.
- This makes that reverse operation non-functional => not a matrix => the inverse does not exist.
