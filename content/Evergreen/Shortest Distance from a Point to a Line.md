- The shortest distance between two points is always the line that makes a $90\degree$ angle with both the surfaces.
- Since perp is perpendicular to the projected upon surface, we can use this.
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{RQ} = \text{perp}_{\vec d}(\vec{PR})\\
\end{align}
$$
Point $Q$ can be found by:
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{OQ} = \vec{OP} + \text{proj}_{\vec d}(\vec{PR})
\end{align}
$$
