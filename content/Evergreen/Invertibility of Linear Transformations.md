- A linear transformation is invertible iff:
$$
\begin{align}
M\circ L = \text{Id} = L \circ M\\\\
L^{-1} = M
\end{align}
$$

- A tf is invertible if we can find another tf that "cancels out" the effect of the first transformation.

- This translates nicely to their associated matrices:
$$
[L]^{-1} = [M]
$$
