All of them come around to the same thing:
- If you have a set of basis vectors.
- And there an $k$ vectors in the set.
- Then any other set of basis vectors, **must** have $n$ elements.

- If you have _less_ than $n$, then your set cannot span the subspace.
- If you have _more_ than $n$, then your set is linearly dependent.
