- Since column 2 has no pivot, $x_2$ does not have an expression of its own.
- Instead $x_2$ is used inside $x_1$'s expression.
- Since there are no restrictions on $x_2$, we call it a free parameter.
- To make the _freeness_ clear, we replace $x_2$ with $t$ in the equations.

- So if a column doesn't have a pivot, we get a free variable.
