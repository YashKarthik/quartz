- To prove equality of sets we need to prove that both sets are subsets ($\subseteq$) of each other.
- So if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$ then $A = B$.

- To prove Span A $\subseteq$ Span B.
- We need to prove that an element in Span A can be expressed as a linear combination of elements in Span B.
- And vice-versa.

- If proving Span A $\subseteq R^n$.
- We know that $R^n$ is closed under linear combination so it's just a one line proof.
