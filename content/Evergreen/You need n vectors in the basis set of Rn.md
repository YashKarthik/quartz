- The proof in `reference` is pretty weird.

- Since the set of $\vec e_i$ vectors is a basis for $R^n$, every vector in $R^n$ can be represented as a linear combination of $\vec e_i$.
- To represent each component of a vector in $R^n$, we'll need $n\ \vec e_i$  vectors as each can represent only one component.
- Hence $k = n\ \square$.
