We have been playing with systems of the form:
$$
A\vec x = \vec b
$$
Now what if:
$$
\vec b = \lambda\vec x
$$

Basically, $\vec b$ is a scaler multiple of a **non-zero** $\vec x$.

If such a scaler $\lambda$ exists for a non-zero $\vec x$, it is called the eigenvalue of $A$. And $\vec x$ is the corresponding eigenvector of $A$.

- We want $\vec x$ to be a non-zero vector as $A\vec 0 = \lambda \vec 0$ would be true for any scalar $\lambda$.
