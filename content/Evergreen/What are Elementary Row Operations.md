- Since a row of our augmented matrix is equivalent to an equation.
- We can use similar techniques as we used in elimination method.

# Row Swap
Interchange two rows:
$$
R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2
$$
- It doesn't really matter which equation is on top or bottom.
# Row Scale
$$
R_2 : 2R_2
$$
- We do this is elimination all the time to get terms to cancel out.
# Row Addition
$$
R_3: R_3 + 2R_1
$$
- Adding a scalar multiple of one row to another.

- Two systems are equivalent if they have the same solutions.
- Since our original system has the same solutions as our modified system, we can say that row operations do not change the matrix, the two matrices are equivalent.
