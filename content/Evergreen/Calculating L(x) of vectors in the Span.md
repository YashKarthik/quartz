- We have a linear tf: $L: R^n \rightarrow R^m$.
- We have a set $S = \{ \vec x_1,\ ...,\ \vec x_k \} \in R^n$
- For each $\vec x_i$, we know $L(\vec x_i)$
- Since every vector in Span(S) is just a linear combination of the vectors in S and since $L$ preserves linear combinations, we can calculate $L$ for every vector in the span.
- The proof/example in the `reference` doesn't make sense.
