- The essential idea is to harness the movement of water.
- The water moves due to gravity of the Moon and the Sun.

- That's a large scale view. From a closer point of view, the water is essentially flowing from one direction to another, and back, four times a day.
- If we place turbines obstructing these movements, we get electricity.
# Pros
- Uses the natural movement of water to spin turbines.
- Predictable (unlike solar, wind), tides change four times a day.
- Gives a good amount of energy.
- Sustainable / [[Renewable Energy]]
# Methods

- [[References/Tidal Turbines (underwater turbines)]]
- Dynamic Tidal Power.
- Tidal Lagoon.
