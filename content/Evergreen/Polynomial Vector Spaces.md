- Once we realized how powerful vector spaces are, we started using them for everything.

Here, we define $P_n(\mathbb R)$ to be the set of all real polynomials of degree at most $n$.
$$
P_n(\mathbb R) = \{a_0\ + a_1x\ +\ ...\ +\ a_nx^n |\ a_0, a_1,\ ...\ a_n \in \mathbb R \}
$$
- This gives us multiple variants like $P_1, P_2$ etc.
- We create a vector space out of this set by defining equality, addition and scalar multiplication (it's obv, we basically dance with coefficients of the respective terms).

This makes $P_n(\mathbb R)$ a vector space for nonnegative integers $n$.

- Since $P_n(\mathbb R)$ is a vector space, we can define subspaces and find their bases and play with that kinda stuff.
### Standard Basis
$$
B = \{1, x,\ ...,\ x^n\}
$$
