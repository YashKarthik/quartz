- It is the set of vectors that are outputs of $A^T\vec x$.
- It is the span of rows of $A$.

# Theorem 28.4
- $\text{Row}(A)$ is a subspace of $R^n$.
- $n$ cuz there are $n$ columns in the transpose of A.
- And a matrix-vector product is basically a linear combination of the columns of the matrix (here, the matrix being a transpose).
