- A subspace is basically a set of vectors that is closed under linear combination (vector addition and scalar multiplication).
- So any element in the subspace can be represented as a linear combination of the other elements in the set.
- So subspace is very similar to span, except with span we define the set we are spanning across. Eg: $\text{Span } A$ is the linear combinations of vectors in $A$ specifically.
