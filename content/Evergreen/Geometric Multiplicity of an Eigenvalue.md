Geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is equal to the dimension of the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue.

- It gives us an idea of the set of vectors that satisfy $(A -\lambda I)\vec x = 0$.
	- Do they form a plane, are they all on a line, stuff like that.
- So it gives us an idea of the sort of vectors that are _unchanged_ during the vector transformations.
	- Maybe a particular line through the origin doesn't get knocked off it's span after the transformation.

- This too is defined for each eigenvalue.
- Denoted by $g_\lambda$.
