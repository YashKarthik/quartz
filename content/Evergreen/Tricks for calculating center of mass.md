- Center of mass of a geometrically symmetric body is same as the geometric center of the body.
- If the body has an axis of symmetry, the COM lies on that axis.
- If we have a system of particles that can be "grouped nicely", then calculated the CoMs of the groups individually and then calculate the net com using that.
