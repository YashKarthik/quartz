- We begin with a system of linear equations.
- Then write down the respective coefficient matrix $A$.
- And the solution vector $\vec b$.
- We can write each each column of our coefficient matrix as a vector $\vec a_1, \vec a_2, \vec a_3$
- Rewriting our system in these new terms we can see that the system is consistent iff:
$$
\vec b = x_1\vec a_1 + x_2\vec a_2 + x_3\vec a_3
$$
- Now to represent this "operation" concisely we define the [[Evergreen/Matrix-Vector Product|Matrix-Vector Product]]
