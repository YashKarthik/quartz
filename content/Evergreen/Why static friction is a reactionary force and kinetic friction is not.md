# Static Friction: $f_s$
- Static friction is a responsive force; i.e. if there is no force pulling an object along a surface, there would be no static friction.
- The magnitude of static friction depends on the magnitude of the force attempting to move the object.
	- If the force pulling the object is small, static friction would be small.
	- As the pulling force increases, our static friction too will increase to match the pulling force.
- After a certain point, the static friction would not be able to match our pulling force, that's when our object finally slides.
# Kinetic Friction: $f_k$
- Kinetic friction does not have a variable magnitude. It has a fixed magnitude and always exerts that same amount of friction regardless of the pulling force.
