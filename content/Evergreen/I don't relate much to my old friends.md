Visiting all these old friends confirmed a feeling I developed over covidâ€“if I was meeting them for the first time now, I probably wouldn't be friends with them. You make friends two ways: 1) you both share a common interest, or, 2) you (both) are friendless/new to the place. I think, in school people usually make friends the second way. I was new to Lawrence and we shared the dorm and they were welcoming and fun people. The only thing remotely _common_ among us was sports. We were all physically fit and generally like sports. This was 7th grade, I didn't even have any interests, I just wanted to be with the cool kids.

These past two years, and the fact that I'm heading to college, I am more inclined to look for people who I have something in common with. If I was too meet them now, I likely wouldn't be friends with them, just acquaintances.

There's also the fact that most of my old friends stayed in touch with each other, while I was MIA most of the time. And also the fact that they partied, drank, smoked up and shit. That's enough to add some ethical distance between us.

I'm still able to pick up our conversations and memories from years ago and vibe with them in that sense. It's just that I don't relate that much to the new them. They just don't seem that ambitious. I felt that back in school too, but I dismissed it as school leaves no time for shit. None of my friends were in Robotics and I had to work hard to carve out time for it. Now it's just more explicit.

In some way, I'm glad I won't be constantly surrounded be my own friends. They would **definitely** hinder my growth as a person.

_Times change. People change. Such is life._

It's nice to have old friends though, to be able to take a break from your current life and relish in memories.
