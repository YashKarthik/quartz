- If we have a set of vectors $B$.
- Then $\text{Span } B$ would be the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in $B$.

- To show that a vector $\vec x$ belongs in $\text{Span } B$, we must show that $\vec x$ can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in $B$.
$$
\begin{align}
\vec x \in \text{ Span}\{\vec v_1,\ ...,\ \vec v_k \}\\
\implies \vec x = c_1\vec v_1 +\  ...\ + c_n\vec v_n
\end{align}
$$
- $B$ is the spanning set for Span(B).
