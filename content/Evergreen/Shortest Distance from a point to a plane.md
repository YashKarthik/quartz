$$
\text{proj}_{\vec n}(\vec{PR})
$$
- The idea is very similar to finding that for the [[Evergreen/Shortest Distance from a Point to a Line|line]] with a few differences.
- To do projections, we need a _receiving vector_, we used $\vec d$ in lines, here we'll use $\vec n$.
- In lines we have a direction vector representing the direction of the line.
- In planes we have a normal vector perpendicular to the plane.
- Since $\vec n$ is perpendicular to the plane, the projection of $\vec PR$ onto $\vec n$ will give us the shortest distance itself.
- The perp will give us the distance from $P$ to $Q$ (the shortest distance-walla point).
- This is opposite to that of the plane where the perp gives the distance and proj gives the point.
