> The net force on a body is equal to the product of the body's mass and its acceleration.

- From experiments, we saw that the net force on an object is proportional to the acceleration of the object.
$$
F \propto a
$$
- Turns out the proportionality constant is the mass of the object!
$$
\vec F = m\vec a
$$
- $1 kg\ ms^{-2} = 1N$
