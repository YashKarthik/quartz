- A vector $\vec s$ is a solution to a system of $m$ equations in $n$ variables if all $m$ equations are satisfied when $x_i = s_i$ for $i = 1, ..., n$.

Eg:
$$
\begin{align}

2x_1 - 2x_2 + 2x_3 = 3\\
x_1 - 5x_3 = 0
\\
\\
\vec s = \begin{bmatrix}
0\\-\frac32\\0
\end{bmatrix}\\

\end{align}
$$
Subbing the respective $s_i$ for the respective $x_i$ we can see that both the equations are satisfied.

# What does it represent
- The system of linear equations here represents two planes ($x_3$).
- $\vec s$ represents a point where the two planes intersect.
