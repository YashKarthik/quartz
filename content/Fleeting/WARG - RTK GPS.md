- Ardupilot has a list of supported GPS that communicate using NMEA protocol.
	- But they are expensive and GPS on sparkfun are better.
	- But we need to write our own firmware for it.

- Figure out what GPS we could use and how they're better than what we have right now,
	- What GPS do we use now?
	-  How does RTK?
	- GNSS vs GPS
		- GNSS is the general term for navigational sattellites.
		- GPS is the American constellation.
		- GNSS Devices can connect to different constellations for improved accuracy.
	- How many antenna
 
- GPS correction data formats 
	- How to transmit over mavlink.
	- Submit corrections over mavlink and ardupilot driver would unpack that and send it to the RTK capable GPS.
	- What correction data format does ardupilot use.
	- driver basically converts correction data from MAVLINk to whatever format the GPS uses
- tasks
	- research what all these terms mean
	- what can be used as a base station
	- make an arch doc
	- research what family of GPS to use (use the same protocol)
		- cheap stuff, expensive stuff,
		- long term what family do we want to invest our development time into
	- feel out what the space is like
	- get a gps
	- write ardupilot snf mission planner driver for it
     
1. Research COTS RTK solutions
2. Research RTK COTS software flow (how, what to edit in ardupilot).
3. Write ground station driver - mission planner.
4. Write ardupilot driver.
	1. Accept mavlink correction packets
	2. Unpack data.
	3. Send to RTK gps.

# GPS Frequencies
- L1, L2, L5 are the three civilian gps frequency bands.
	- L1: 1575.42 MHz
	- L2: 1227.60 MHz
	- L5: 1176.45 MHz
- L5 is the most accurate and is good at cancelling out ionosphere interference.
- But since we're planning on using RTK correction data, L1/L2 is also fine.
