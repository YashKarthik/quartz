**Canon events**:
- Jason is born.
- Thalia and Jason are separated.
- Thalia leaves home.
	- Meets Luke, Annabeth...

# Story
- Beryl Grace has Thalia and learns that her father is Zeus himself.
- Now feels like she's extra special (Tom Riddle -esque) and demands to be made immortal.
- Zeus obviously doesn't, and leaves her soon after Thalia is born. Stating he's got duties and obligations and also to prevent Hera's wrath from falling on Beryl.
- Beryl initially (4 years) tells herself that he'll return soon to take herself and Thalia to Olympus. This time is relatively peaceful excluding the occasional outburst.
- Beryl becomes increasingly unstable and does crazy shit to attract Zeus again.

## Canon event 1: the Birth of Jason Grace:

- **Option 1: Hera gifts Beryl a son**
	- Hera takes pity on Beryl and gifts her a baby.
	- Hera pitying is cool but why gift a baby?
	- For the Prophecy, as a test?
	- And, why take him back two years later? ==this destroys this theory==
- **Option 2: Beryl is wild**
	- Beryl's drunk and wild and hooks up with some random mortal in a random bar.
	- This works, but then why would Jason and Thalia be separated?
	- The original story follows; Beryl doing crazy and crazier shit to get Zeus's attention and Thalia starts doubting her ability to look after Jason.

(choosing option 2).

## Cannot event 1: Separation

- **Option 1: Thalia runs away with Jason**
	- As Beryl's fanatics go off the rails, Thalia takes Jason and runs away from home.
	- Over the next few weeks they travel east, encountering several minor monsters that Thalia manages to kill (?) with an old knife.
	- Eventually, they run into Lycaon's pack. The Hunters of Artemis arrive at the scene and fight off the pack. In the ensuing chaos Thalia and Jason are separated. After the battle, Thalia searches the scene, but to no avail. With the heavily bloodied battlefield and magic masking Jason's scent, the wolves can't catch Jason's scent (so no tracking). She gives up eventually and travels east with the Hunters.
	- Turns out, one of Lycaon's wolves carried Jason away in his blankets. Jason wakes up suddenly and understands that he's in danger. With a sudden surge of superhuman strength, Jason strangles the wolf's throat, killing it.
	- For hours, he lies in the warm undergrowth of _some plants_. Until the wolf goddess Lupa, recognizing his divine blessing, takes him under his care.
	- ==work out the no-tracking part==
- **Option 2: Beryl sacrifices Jason to get Zeus's attention**
