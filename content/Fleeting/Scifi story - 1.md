4:25 AM

I woke with a start. The cell smelled of cigarette smoke and bottles of aftershave; I heard the computer fans spinning hard, generating dreams to keep me under, but the jarring ringtone jerked me out of simulated sleep. The caller id read Liam Grey and I knew something had gone wrong.

15 minutes later, I was in a conference room with three other techs, a pretty lawyer, and Liam Grey.

"A kid died" said Liam. "Seizures while jacked in". Everyone's faces tensed. "We haven't had such an incident in over 3 years."

"We crossed the NDHA limit", said one of the techs. "Crammed in too many adds."

"Yes, but the research on that is at least a decade old."

...

"Go to the archives. Dig up the simulations and our tests on this." said Liam, looking at me.

The Archives. The largest datacenter in America. It started as an indexing project for organizing the technical teams' internal documentation, but the tech was too good and soon every stupid slack message is a vector in the database.

I sat down on my desk, wired myself up to my computer, and took out my keyboardâ€“a Japanese custom made mechanical board with the perfect level of tactility, tuned to my fingers, and a rare metal base which _thocked_ like horse hooves when I hit the zone. I rested my fingers on the home row, the slight bumps on F and J like familiar grooves on the skate-park floor, and jacked in.

My vision went black for a moment and the scene came into focus.
