- Tron: https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Mechatronics-Option
- Physics: https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Physical-Sciences-Option

- The AI option seems to have more flex than TRON.
- Prolly won't take physics, too hard. I think I'll read it myself on the side (will I though?).

- Consider a pure math minor: https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Pure-Mathematics-Minor1 (calc + other stuff too)
- Consider applied math minor: https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Applied-Mathematics-Minor1 (mainly calc)
- Also look into Combinatorics & Optimization: https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Combinatorics-and-Optimization-Minor2
