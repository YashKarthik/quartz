In 1984, Benjamin Bloom published a [paper](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/wvu926pd9qcgh539955u7/x0hph6hn47v77gtg/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIubWl0LmVkdS81Ljk1L3JlYWRpbmdzL2Jsb29tLXR3by1zaWdtYS5wZGY=) showing how Mastery Learning combined with one-on-one tutoring led to a two-sigma improvement in learning outcomes. We know this faster learning curve is possible. The problem is that we can’t possibly give every student a personal tutor. It’s too expensive. But digital tutors might offer the answer. In 2009 [The United States Navy](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/wvu926pd9qcgh539955u7/6qheh8hp3282pva9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVzc3dyb25nLmNvbS9wb3N0cy92YldCSkdXeVd5S3lveExCZS9kYXJwYS1kaWdpdGFsLXR1dG9yLWZvdXItbW9udGhzLXRvLXRvdGFsLXRlY2huaWNhbC1leHBlcnRpc2U=) showed how effective digital tutors can be for technical training. Using their tool, new recruits took 16 weeks to reach the level of knowledge of somebody with five years of experience. That was more than a decade ago. Modern technology can help us do even better and ultimately solve Bloom’s two-sigma problem while meaningfully lowering the cost of education.
