Hello there. It's nice to finally meet you.

I'm Yash Karthik, a programmer and writer.

Five years ago I awoke in a strange new world: I learned to code.

My friend and I were tasked with cleaning-up the robotics lab after a late night session. Rather than spending hours sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us (finishing the task in a few days instead of hours xD).

I knew how transformative technology is. It had been all around us. But actually leveraging it myself to automate a mundane task was when I truly _grokked_ the power of technology.

Since then, I've built fast and beautiful web apps; efficient and scalable backends; cute and silly robots; and learned to embrace the lightness of being a _perpetual beginner_.

From nerdy tech-talks about the latest JS framework to investigating the linguistic roots of Harry Potter spells, many things capture my interest.

Through suggestion I tried out writing and found it ideal for experimenting and sketching out my ideas. Most of what I write never leaves my computer, but things that I'm most passionate about find their way into my occasional posts here.
