I can help you with the "**how**". That was one of my biggest hangups once too.

Observe girls around you. Find some that you think are interesting. (not just one, you need to talk to many girls).

You can open with a few different methods... do you need help with just talking to girls?

If so, try this:

Observe something uniqure about them, it could be something they are **holding, wearing, or doing**. Then **compliment** it, then ask them about it.

Girls like compliments, just don't compliment her looks.

I recently did this with a girl I just met in a donut shop, she walks in and had on all purple, like a grey\purple shirt, purple pants, and pink\purple sneakers. I love purple... so I made **solid eye contact, smiled** and said:

"hey... OMG... I love your outfit... you are wearing all... _purple_... I _love_ purple... but even I couldn't pull off wearing _all_ purple... is purple your favorite color... is purple the _only_ color you wear?"

We laughed, she blushed, and while waited for our donuts to get made, we chatted about colors, fashion, and sneakers...

As you can see, I just observed something unique about her, I teased her a bit, commented, and asked her about it. This is how it starts.

You are looking for shared or common interests. Things you have in common.

If you are in school, then ask the girls about their major, their classes, their commute, their cars, their ride, what they like to do when they ride, what do they listen to... the goal is start talking.

You want to ask open ended questions, the kind that can't be answered with a yes, no, maybe, fine, ok, etc.

These questions are your friends:
1. **WHAT** do you like about that?
2. **WHAT** made you want that?
3. **WHAT** scares you about that?

Essentially any question that uncovers “What makes you **feel** that way?” or “What makes you **think** that way?”

WHAT tends to work better than WHY because WHAT feels like you’re curious and WHY can sometimes feel like an attack. “WHY do you like that?" “Because I do. What's your problem?!"

You don’t just listen to respond. You listen to understand. You go deeper.
1. Offer your own emotional information
2. AND dig for their emotional information.

Keep digging until you understand their way of thinking. Until you feel the emotion they’re talking about. Then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own.

This is how you bond on an emotional level with someone, you find similar, shared, feelings.

So now, you have a rapport going with the girls, you have discussed shared interests and shared emotional feelings about things...

**WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO ASK HER OUT and WHAT DO YOU SAY?**

Wait until you are talking about a shared interest. Let's say mutual appreciation for Dinosaurs. During a discussion you can say "I am going to see the Dinosaurs exhibit on Saturday. You **should** come with me". The message you are relaying is that you plan to do something that you both like and she can join you if she wants. It can involve any activity or shared interest – a walk, a coffee, a film, an event.

In my opinion this is an excellent and versatile way to ask someone out. It is non needy and low pressure – if she says she has plans you are still going to be doing the activity – just without her. You can say (while half smiling) “too bad” and go on talking about why you're excited about doing it. The nice thing about this is it sets up a conversation hook for the next time you talk. She will say “How was the exhibit” or you can say “I had a great time at the museum” etc. Most importantly, this technique makes it easy for her to say yes.

TL;DR
1. Talk to lots of girls - build rapport - looking for shared interests
2. Ask open ended questions
3. ask any question that uncovers “What makes you **feel** that way?”
4. share a similar experience of your own.
5. Make solid eye contact, smile
6. "I am going to see the Dinosaurs exhibit on Saturday. You **should** come with me".

Rinse and Repeat. Its a numbers game. You will need to do this many times. Rejection is a part of life, you **will** get rejected, a lot. But if you keep at it, you fail your way to success, and eventually find someone who likes you and will go out with you.

Are you in a STEM program? Many STEM guys have a hard time with this.

> Make female friends! I have a fair amount.

You say you have female friends, this is a great start... really.

Maybe you just need to learn to **flirt and escalate** a bit. DO you flirt? with your female friends? Do you socialize with them? and their friends?

I have some pointers on flirting and escalating too... if you want them
