Spend more time _living_ the term rather than getting through it.
# Don't let school interrupt your learning
Yes I'm in university to learn. But there are so **many** different directions from which knowledge comes. Don't restrict yourself to just technical knowledge from classes. Technical skills are practiced not learned.

=> Build more: 
1. Projects.
2. Projects with others (Socratica, other nerds, hackathons).
3. WARG.

And try to read a bit too.

But don't ignore school completely either–find a balance.
# Say yes more
I missed out on TheResidency application cuz I wasn't sure what I'd build. WTF!!!? Just fucking apply.
# Meet more people
University is the last time you're gonna be absolutely **surrounded** with smart, ambitious, beautiful people. You just need to say hi, everyone's equally awkward.

And after you find people in the world you wanna hang out with. Spend time with them.
# Waste time, meaningfully
Chill meaningfully–with people you care, doing things you care. Not just sitting in a room together and scrolling.
