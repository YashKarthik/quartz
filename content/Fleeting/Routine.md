## Coding tasks
- Secondary tasks: usually side projects that that are in later stages of development.
- Main tasks: solidity CTFs, reading audits, currently speedrunethereum, or new sideprojects, or new languages.

- Each coding task is done for two days. If can be done in a single day, pair with another short task for the next day.
