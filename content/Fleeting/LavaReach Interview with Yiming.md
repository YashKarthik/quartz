- I like doing hard things:
	- Spent the winter break building a 3d renderer.
	- Spend a lot of time building things even on school term just cuz I like building.
	- I can't _not_ build. I can't imagine myself wiling away my life, not working hard, just coasting, doing unimportant things.
	- I want to change the world.
	- Why? Why not! What better test of yourself?
	- What better way to test the entirety of you. It tests your endurance, your intellect, your relationships, your luck.
