GPT-3 and DALL-E showed us that AI is also 'creative'. The difference between AI writers and human writers is the same difference between no-code and coding. Limited, yes, but does a reasonably large percent of the job, for much less time / effort.

But is it our 'creativity' that makes us humans? Just stay with me. Creativity is too broad. Think of our brain as System 1 and System 2 (Kanheman). Most, if not all, of our creativity comes from System 2. Writing, painting, coding all take conscious effort. This is what is being AI-ified right now. But our brains have another side - system 1. Even with all the statistics and reasoning of system 2, it's this monkey side that pushes the final button. It's the brain that makes the final decision.

Currently, the decision that AI makes is (almost?) solely based on the probability rankings. But humans don't operate that way. We make our pros and cons columns and write down a bunch of bullets, but the final decision comes from the gut.

I think this is what separates AI and the human brain. The biased, fallible and plain stupid part of our brain that makes us _irrational_.

The probability rankings based decisions win out the vast majority of times, and take less time (nocode vs code), but for the top ~5% most important decisions the AI and human inform each other.
